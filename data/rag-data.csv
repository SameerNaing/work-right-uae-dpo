Regarding the Regulation of Employment Relationships: 
1. In accordance with this Decree Law, employers, employees, and their 
beneficiaries are entitled to dispute any rights arising from the employment 
relationship. Following receipt of the request, the Ministry will review it and 
take the necessary steps to facilitate an amicable resolution. 
 
2. The Ministry will render a final judgment on any dispute submitted to it in 
accordance with the provisions set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this 
document if the value of the claim is not more than fifty thousand (50,000)  
UAE dirhams (AED) or if neither party complies with an amicable settlement 
decision relating to the subject matter, regardless of the value of the claim. 
 
3. The Ministry has the authority to resolve the dispute in accordance with the 
provisions of paragraph (3) of this article, and the decision shall be annotated 
with execution in accordance with customary practice. If the decision is not 
satisfactory to either party, either party may file a lawsuit before the relevant"

following notification of the decision. Upon filing, the court will schedule a 
hearing to consider the case within three (3) working days, and the case will

Article (3) 
Basis for Calculating the Basic Subscription Fee 
Under the provisions of Article (6) of the aforementioned Cabinet Resolution No. (96) of 
2023, the basic monthly subscription amount is calculated as follows: 
a. Full-time beneficiaries:  a percentage of (5.83%) of their monthly basic salary if they 
serve less than five (5) years, and a percentage of (8.33%) if they serve more than five 
(5) years. 
b. Beneficiaries under other employment patterns (part time or job sharing): The 
subscription percentage set out in Paragraph (A) of this article applies to the basic salary 
calculated in accordance with the Decree Law. 
c. According to Federal Decree Law No. (33) of 2021 and its executive regulations, the 
subscription percentage is calculated from the basic salary. As per the percentage 
provided in Paragraph (A) of this Article, the percentage of the number of working 
hours specified in the employment contract will be divided by the number of working 
hours in the full-time contract per year, multiplied by the percentage. 
Example: 
For a part-time contract of four hours per day, as opposed to eight hours per day for a 
full-time contract, the calculation is as follows: 
First 
: By dividing the number of working hours included in the part-time contract 
by the number of working hours included in the full-time contract, we obtain 0.5 
working hours. 
Second : In this case, the percentage is calculated as 0.5 x 100 = 50% 
Third 
: In this example, multiply 50% x the percentage mentioned in paragraph (a) 
above as follows: 
▪ A beneficiary whose employment does not exceed five years: 50% x 5.83% = 
2.415% 
▪ A beneficiary whose employment exceeds five years: 50% x 8.33% = 4.165%"

The UAE Government will implement the remote work system, on a full time or part time basis, even during ordinary situations. The new remote work system will continue alongside the traditional work system, wherein the employees will be executing their work at the entities’ premises. It will be for current and future Emirati employees who are eligible to work remotely based on set criteria.

In April 2020, the UAE Government issued [Cabinet Resolution No. 27 for 2020 Regarding Remote Work System in the Federal Government](https://u.ae/-/media/Information-and-services/Jobs/Cabinet-Resolution-No-27-for-2020-Regarding-Remote-Work-System-in-the-Federal-Government.pdf)

This resolution applies to current and future Emirati employees who are eligible to work remotely as determined by the federal entities, in coordination with [Federal Authority for Government Human Resources](https://www.fahr.gov.ae/Portal/en/home.aspx)
(FAHR) and in accordance with the human resources procedures and electronic systems approved by the Federal Government.

The resolution mentions a set of criteria that ministries and federal entities must observe to determine if a job can be done remotely. Jobs allowed for remote working must meet the following conditions:

- the job must be of divisible nature
- it can be automated
- its inputs can be handled through electronic systems.

Only those employees would be selected for working remotely who:

- occupy a job that can be performed remotely
- are sincere, abide by quality and accuracy of work and confidentiality of information
- have attained performance expectations, at least up to the last performance appraisal
- have not been subject to any administrative penalties for breach of [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.fahr.gov.ae/Portal/en/legislations-and-guides/systems/professional-conduct-document.aspx)

uae-jobs,types-of-leaves-and-entitlements-in-the-private-sector__sick-leave,"## Sick leave

### Eligibility for a sick leave (paid and unpaid)

An employee is entitled to a sick leave of not more than 90 days per year, only after the end of probationary period. The 90 days’ sick leave can be continuous or intermittent, and the salary is paid as follows:

- full pay for the first 15 days
- half pay for the next 30 days
- no pay for the rest 45 days.

However, during the probationary period, the employee may get a sick leave without pay, subject to the approval of the employer and based on a medical report issued by the medical entity that stipulates the necessity of the leave.

Note: The above provisions are subject to conditions and do not apply to sick leave because of occupational illness.

On the other hand, the employee is ineligible for a paid sick leave in the following situations:

- during the probation period
- if the illness directly arises from the misconduct of the worker, such as the consumption of alcohol or narcotics
- if the worker violated the safety instructions in accordance with the effective legislations in the UAE, and the rules set out in the firm's regulations, which the employee was informed of.

### Notifying your employer of a sick leave

According to [Article 31 of the UAE Labour Law,](https://www.mohre.gov.ae/en/laws-and-regulations/laws.aspx)
the employee must notify the employer about his sickness within maximum three days and submit a medical report on his condition, issued by the medical entity.

### Can an employee be terminated on grounds of sickness?

An employer may not dismiss an employee or give him a termination notice while the employee is on sick leave. If the employee uses all of his 90 days’ sick leave and has not been able to report to work afterwards, the employer may terminate his services. In such a case, the employee shall be entitled to the end of service benefits in accordance with the provisions of the labour law.

uae-jobs,jobs__working-for-two-employers-at-one-time,"# Working for two employers at one time

The UAE's Labour Law permits working for two employers. This page covers provisions for people who live in the UAE on work visa and family visa.

### General provisions

Since 2010, the UAE's Labour Law made provisions which allow an employee to have a part-time job along with a full-time one subject to certain conditions. The employee can work part-time after getting the work permit from MoHRE.

The fee for part-time work permit includes an application fee of AED 100 and an approval fee of AED 500.

As per Federal Decree Law No. 2 of 2007, if an expatriate is caught working for another company without an official permit, then a fine of AED 50,000 will be applied to the hiring company, in addition to other penalties in case of repeating the offence.

### For people on a work visa

Emiratis, other GCC nationals and expatriate employees who are living in the UAE on a work visa, can take up a second job, upon getting a part-time work permit from MoHRE, which is valid for one year.

Part-time work permit holders are allowed to work in another company at the same time as working in the current company on a part-time basis for less than eight hours per day.

### For people on family visa

Those who live in the UAE on a family visa can take up a second job after getting a part-time work permit with an NOC from the sponsor. Such work permits can be issued to men and women between 18 and 65 years of age.

### Part-time contract system

In 2018, [Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation](http://www.mohre.gov.ae/en/home.aspx)
 (MoHRE) implemented a new rule which allows the companies to recruit skilled workers from inside the country or from abroad under part-time contract system. These types of contracts are limited only to skilled workers, namely holders of university degrees or higher and those who completed two or three years diploma in any technical or scientific field.

Under this new system, part-time contract employees can take several part-time jobs without the approval of the original or other secondary employers; however, they are obligated to take permit from the MoHRE.

uae-jobs,jobs__employment-of-people-with-special-needs,"# Employment of people of determination

The UAE Government provides for equal and fair employment opportunities to Emiratis who are people of determination (people with special needs). Ministry of Community Development, Zayed Higher Organization for People of Determination and Community Development Authority facilitate job opportunities for people of determination.

### Employment laws

The UAE provides for equal and fair employment opportunities to Emiratis of determination. Two laws protect employment rights of citizens of determination. They are: [Federal Law No. 29 of 2006 Concerning the Rights of People with Special Needs](https://www.abudhabi.ae/portal/public/en/homepage/religion-and-community/people-of-determination-le/federal-law-no-29-of-2006-concerning-the-rights-of-people-of-determination?_afrLoop=4639169894242044)
 and [Dubai Government Law No. 2 of 2014.](https://www.cda.gov.ae/ar/aboutus/Documents/Concerning%20Protection%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Persons%20with%20Disabilities%20in%20the%20Emirate%20of%20Dubai%20-%20Law%202%20-%202014%20-%20EN.pdf)

The federal law stipulates that UAE nationals with special needs have the right to work and occupy public positions. Article 16 of the law provides: UAE nationals with special needs have the right to work and hold public office. Their special needs shall not be a barrier for their nomination and selection for a job. Special needs should be taken into account while testing the candidate's competency for the job.

[Resolution No. 43 of 2018 in support of the people of determination](http://mediaoffice.ae/en/media-center/news/13/8/2018/hhshkmohd-law.aspx)
aims to support the rights of people of determination (people with special needs or disabilities) in the field of employment by enabling access to opportunities in the labour market.

The resolution requires government entities to protect the rights of people of determination and to ensure their right to work on an equal basis with others and not to be discriminated against.

The resolution stressed the need to provide working and health conditions for people of determination and not to terminate their services or refer them to retirement due to disability or its occurrence after appointment, unless retirement age is reached or a competent medical committee decision states they are not fit to work.

Further, it stipulates that the private sector should be encouraged to integrate people of determination into their institutions and grant them exemptions and privileges.

The law issued by Dubai Government protects the rights of citizens with special needs in the emirate of Dubai.

The UAE has also ratified the [United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html)
. This way, the UAE strives to empower and promote the social inclusion of all.

### Rehabilitation and job opportunities for people of determination

Ministry of Interior's [Centers for Rehabilitation and Employment of people with special needs](https://www.moi.gov.ae/en/media.center/news/news.8733.aspx)
 empower special needs' individuals through training, rehabilitation and facilitating job opportunities.

Other organisations which facilitate job opportunities for people of determination are:

- [Zayed Higher Organization for People of Determination](https://www.tamm.abudhabi/en/life-events/individual/SupportCommunityEnvironment/PoD-Support/requestforemploymentforpeopleofdetermination)
- [Community Development Authority in Dubai (El Kayt Program)](https://www.cda.gov.ae/en/socialcare/PeopleWithDisabilities/Pages/PWDEmploymentElKayt.aspx)

uae-jobs,employment-in-the-private-sector__working-hours,"## Working hours and overtime

Private sector workers are required to work 8 hours per day or 48 hours per week. During the holy month of Ramadan, working hours are reduced by 2 hours, every day.

Following are key provisions concerning working hours in the private sector:

- Article 17 of the [Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021 on the Regulation of Labour Relations in the Private Sector](https://www.mohre.gov.ae/en/laws-and-regulations/laws.aspx)
  , the ‘UAE Labour Law’identifies the normal working hours for the private sector as 8 hours per day, or 48 hours per week.
- The daily working hours may increase or decrease for certain economic sectors or certain categories of workers, as specified by the ‘Executive Regulations of the Labour Law’.
- The time spent by the worker in commuting from his place of residence to his workplace is not included in the working hours, except for certain categories of workers as specified by the ‘Executive Regulations of the Labour Law’.
- If the worker works for more than one employer, the original employer and other employers may not require the worker to work more than the hours agreed upon in the employment contract, unless the worker agrees to do so in writing.
- If the worker requests to perform his work remotely, either from within the UAE or from abroad, the employer must stipulate specific working hours.
- The worker has the right to have one or more breaks, if he works five consecutive hours. These breaks must not be less than one hour. Breaks are not calculated within the working hours.

According to Ministerial Resolution No. 44  of 2022, all work performed directly under the sun and in open places shall not be allowed between the peak hours of 12.30 pm and 3 pm from 15 June to 15 September every year. Read about [the rules relating to mid-day break during summer](https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/jobs/health-and-safety-at-workplace)

**Overtime**

- The employer may ask the worker to work overtime, provided the number of extra hours does not exceed two hours in one day.
- If the nature of the work requires the worker to work beyond the normal working hours, then he will be entitled to a pay equal to normal working hours' remuneration (which is based on basic salary) plus 25 per cent of that pay. It could increase to 50 per cent if overtime is done between 10 pm and 4 am. This rule does not apply on workers who work on basis of shifts.
- If the circumstances require the worker to work on his off-day, as specified in the labour contract, or work regulations, then the worker will be entitled to a substitute rest day, or to a pay equal to normal working hours' remuneration (which is based on basic salary) plus 50 per cent of that pay.

uae-visa-emirates-id,visa-and-emirates-id__tips-to-avoid-labour-and-visa-fraud,"## Tips to stay safe from labour and visa fraud

If somebody offers you a job in the UAE, he/she has to give you an offer letter issued by the UAE’s Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE). You can check the validity of such offer as stated below. Visit or tourist visa does not give you the right to work in the UAE. Working under visit or tourist visa may subject the person to penalties and legal liability.

People who want to enter the UAE for the purpose of work, visit, investment, residence or any other legal purpose could be exposed to visa fraud. Therefore, we listed below some tips to follow before coming to the UAE.

1.  If you are [offered a job in the UAE](https://u.ae/information-and-services/jobs/employment-in-the-private-sector/job-offers-and-work-permits-and-contracts/expatriates-employment-in-private-sector)

    ).
3.  After you sign the offer letter, the employer will send you an employment visa to enter the UAE. Refer to points 8 and 9 below to verify visa/entry permit validity.
4.  Visit or tourist entry permit/visa does not give you right to work in the UAE. Working under visit or tourist visa will bring you penalties and legal liability.
5.  You should know that the employer is responsible for payment of recruitment expenses as per the UAE’s Labour Law.
6.  Make sure that the company legally exists. You can search the company’s English and Arabic name in the [National Economic register](https://ner.economy.ae/)
    and get company details.
7.  Get your queries answered by MoHRE at telephone number 0097168027666, email [ask@mohre.gov.ae](mailto:ask@mohre.gov.ae)
    or [chat service](https://www.mohre.gov.ae/en/contact-us.aspx)
    .
8.  If you have entry permit/visa issued from Dubai, please verify its validity at the [GDRFA’s website](https://www.gdrfad.gov.ae/en)

uae-jobs,job-offers-and-work-permits-and-contracts__expatriates-employment-in-private-sector,"# Job offers and the employment process

The employment process in the private sector involves receiving a formal job offer, signing the employment contract, receiving the work permit and then, receiving the work visa. After the signing of the contract, the employer is not allowed to alter or replace any provisions of the offer letter unless the employee consents to it, and such changes are within the scope of law.

### Related eServices

Find related [eServices for the employers and employees](https://www.mohre.gov.ae/en/services.aspx)
on the eServices page of Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation.

### Receiving a job offer

The employment process in the private sector involves receiving a formal job offer, signing the employment contract, receiving a work permit and a work visa.

The offer letter contains important details of the job and an annex that summarises the most important aspects of the UAE Labour Law. Both parties must sign these documents.

As per labour reform regulations effective 2016, an offer letter made to a foreign worker becomes legally binding after it is signed by both parties. An offer letter to a foreign worker signed by both parties becomes a legal contract.

Hence, after signing, the employer is not allowed to alter or replace any provisions of the offer letter unless such changes have the consent of both the employer and the employee, are within the scope of law and do not compromise the rights of the employee.

The employer must ensure that the employee has read the offer letter and understood it. If it is proved that a worker did not go through the annexes before signing the labour contract, the employer will be fined AED 20,000 for submitting incorrect data to MoHRE.

If the employee is in the UAE, he must sign the offer letter before the employer can seek MoHRE's preliminary approval for his employment.

Employers must disclose the terms of the offer letter to MoHRE. A copy of the offer letter is stored in the MoHRE's database. Employees are issued work permits based on these offer letters.

### Signing the contract

The employment contract is a document signed between the employer and the employee in which the latter undertakes to serve the employer and works under his management against an agreed fee paid by the employer.

The employment contract should be based on the offer letter signed by both parties and must be submitted to MoHRE within 14 days of the employee's arrival in the UAE based on the employment entry permit or from the date of status change (if you are in a status which allows you to transfer your visa; i.e. not having violated any law).

**Language of employment contract**

In January 2016, MoHRE approved a third language to be added on the job offer, labour contract and annexure.

In addition to Arabic and English, employees can choose from the following 9 languages: Bengali, Chinese, Dari, Hindi, Malayalam, Nepalese, Sinhalese, Tamil and Urdu.

This applies to workers coming from outside and those residing in the UAE that are seeking a new job, or moving from one company to another.

It covers matters related to working hours, overtime, leaves, vacation and public holidays, employing juveniles, employee records, safety standards, minimum wage, termination of employment, end of service gratuity payments, work injuries amongst others.

The new law introduces several work models such as full-time, part-time, temporary and flexible. It abolishes the ‘unlimited’ type of contracts and admitted only limited or fixed-term contracts. It grants new types of leaves and tackles issues related to harassment, bullying, physical violence and psychological abuse against employees.

The law prohibits forced labour and discrimination on the basis of gender, race, colour, sex, religion, national or social origin or disability. It also spells out employers’ obligations towards employees.

The law applies to all employees working in the UAE, whether UAE nationals or expatriates. However, it does not apply to:

, with the view to place the country's passport on the list of the five most important passports in the world upon the directives of Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs.

The ranking was mainly boosted from its Schengen visa waiver obtained in 2015. The UAE is the first Arab nation whose citizens enjoy a visa waiver to the 26 Schengen countries, which make up most of Europe.

- Do not pay. If the hiring company or the agency asks you for money to process the visa or medical test, it is not a genuine company.
- Learn Arabic. Knowledge of Arabic (at least speaking) would be an advantage.
- Keep yourself updated about your field of work.
- Be realistic about your earning potential.
- Grow your network.
- Increase your general knowledge about the region and its social and cultural value system.

---

An employment contract may be for full time or part time. Type of work arrangements may be temporary work, flexible work, remote work or job sharing.

---

**Fixed-term contracts**

According to [Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021 on the Regulation of Labour Relations in the Private Sector](https://www.mohre.gov.ae/en/laws-and-regulations/laws.aspx)
[, the ‘UAE Labour Law](https://www.mohre.gov.ae/en/laws-and-regulations/laws.aspx)
’ (which came into effect as of 2 February 2022), a worker can be hired on a fixed-term employment contract. The term may be extended or renewed for a similar or shorter duration.

If the contract is not renewed or extended upon its expiry, and the parties continue to perform the obligations of the contract, the contract is then considered renewed under the same terms and conditions as those of the original contract.

Any extension or renewal of the terms of the employment contract will be added when calculating an employee’s end of services benefits.

The law also stipulates that unlimited employment contracts are to be converted into fixed-term employment contracts, in accordance with this decree law, within one year of the effective date of the existing contract and may be extended by the Cabinet for further periods as required in public interest. Meanwhile, the provisions of this decree law shall also apply to unlimited employment contracts entered into in accordance with the Federal Law No. 8 of 1980.

**Probation period**

The probation period of the employee must not exceed six months, or be extended for another term. When the employee completes the probation period and continues in service, the probation will be calculated as part of his service.

If the employer wants to terminate the employee for any reason during the probation period, he has to give 14 days’ prior written notice.

If an employee wants to change the job while on probation, to join another employer in the UAE, he has to give the employer a written notice of minimum one month. In this case, the new employer has to compensate the current employer for the employee’s recruitment cost, unless it is otherwise agreed between the current employer and the employee.

However, if an employee resigns from his employment during the probation period, with the intention to leave the job and the UAE, he must provide prior written notice of 14 days.

Should the resigning employee return to the UAE within three months of his departure on a new work permit, the new employer will be liable to compensate the previous employer for the employee’s recruitment costs, unless otherwise agreed between the current employer and the employee.

**Non-compete restrictions**

Article 10 of the UAE Labour Law permits employers to include non-compete restrictions in the employment contracts. These restrictions must be limited to the extent necessary to protect the business’s legitimate interests and defined in respect of time, place and the nature of work. The maximum restrictive period is for two years from the date of the expiry of the employment contract.

**Types of work arrangements**

Types of work arrangements

The Labour law admits the following models of work arrangements as follows:

- Full time – under this system, an employee works for one employer only on a full-time basis
- Part time – under such contract, an employee works for one or more employers for a specific number of hours or days
- Temporary work – under this system, an employee works on a specific assignment and the contract ends upon its completion
- Flexible working – under this system, working hours or days may change depending on the business needs of the employer
- Remote work - under this system, all or part of the work is performed outside the workplace.
- Job sharing - under such contract, the tasks and duties are divided amongst workers as agreed upon, in advance. The rules of a part-time work model apply on the job-sharing contracts.

This is a full-time position with a salary of at least AED 4000 per month. Following graduation, the Emirati student must remain employed at the same firm for a period not less than the study period, in a profession within the same specialty, in accordance with the employment contract applicable to nationals within the private sector.

uae-jobs,insurance__insurance-system-for-employees-in-the-private-sector,"# Insurance against defaulting employers

Instead of keeping a bank guarantee of AED 3,000 with the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation, employers can opt to buy insurance for workers. Called Taa-meen, the insurance will provide a maximum insurance coverage of AED 20,000 to every worker and protect them from the company’s bankruptcy or failure to get their legitimate dues. In case the insurance company pays the worker, the employer will have to repay the same to the insurance company.

### Insurance system for workers

On 15 October 2018, [Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation](http://www.mohre.gov.ae/en/home.aspx)
(MoHRE) implemented the current insurance policy called Taa-meen, for workers. The policy is intended to be an alternative option for employers keeping a bank guarantee of AED 3,000 while recruiting a new worker.

Bank guarantee and workers’ protection insurance scheme

According to [Ministerial Resolution No. 318 of 2022 Concerning Bank Guarantees and Employees Protection Insurance Scheme](https://u.ae/-/media/Mohre-resolutions/Ministerial-Resolution-No318-of-2022-Concerning-Bank-Guarantees-and-Employees-Protection-Insurance-S.pdf)
(PDF, 461 KB), establishments may choose one of the following two options for the workers:

1.  Procure a bank guarantee, duly issued from a bank operating in the UAE. The bank guarantee must not be less than AED 3,000 for each worker, valid for one year form its issue date, renewable automatically and paid upon MoHRE’s request, without any restrictions.
2.  Buy an insurance policy for the worker.

### Cost of the new insurance policy

An insurance policy’s costs depend on the product as shown below:

|                                                                          |                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Insurance product**                                                    | **Insurance premium (for each certificate/transaction) in AED** |
| Skilled labour                                                           | 137.50                                                          |
| Low-skilled labour                                                       | 180                                                             |
| High-risk establishments, not compliant with the wages protection system | 250                                                             |
| Domestic workers                                                         | 105                                                             |

A policy is valid for 30 months.

**Where can insurance be procured?**

The employer can purchase an insurance policy form the ‘[Insurance pool’.](https://dubins-wpp.ae/en)

### Whom does it protect?

It protects the benefits and rights of the private sector workers and domestic helpers.

### How does the new insurance policy work?

- **For workers currently in service**

  For workers who are already secured under the bank guarantee of AED 3,000, the employer has the option to either change them into the new insurance system or keep them under the old bank guarantee system. However, the employer can shift current workers under the new insurance system only after renewing their permits, not before.

- **For new workers**

Upon recruiting a new worker, the employer has the option to either submit AED 3,000 as bank guarantee on behalf of the worker, as per the rules and regulations of the bank guarantee system, or insure them under the new insurance policy.

### Coverage and limit of the policy

In case of a company’s bankruptcy or failure to pay the workers’ benefits, the new policy will provide a maximum insurance coverage of AED 20,000 per worker. It will cover any labour entitlements mentioned in [Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021 Regarding the Regulation of Employment Relationship](https://www.mohre.gov.ae/en/laws-and-regulations/laws.aspx)
, as amended and its Executive Regulations. It will also cover domestic labour entitlements, provided for in [Federal Law No. 10 of 2017 on Domestic Workers](https://migrationpolicy.unescwa.org/policy/federal-law-no-10-2017#:~:text=10%20introduces%20measures%20for%20the,contracts%2C%20and%20providing%20dispute%20settlement.#:~:text=10%20introduces%20measures%20for%20the,contracts%2C%20and%20providing%20dispute%20settlement.)
, as amended and the resolutions issued for its execution.

For domestic workers, the policy covers the following:

- the cost of worker’s replacement, in case of discontinuation of work
  - if the worker is medically unfit
  - if the worker decides to terminate employment unilaterally
- unpaid wages and entitlements
- service benefits
- unpaid vacations and overtime
- airfare to home country and work injuries’ compensations.

**General provisions**

The coverage of the dues by the insurance company does not relieve the employers from their responsibilities. Employers would still have to pay back to the insurance company all dues which the latter paid to the worker.

If the employer does not repay the insurance company, MoHRE will suspend the employer’s file and freeze new work permits. It will also require the employer to provide AED 3,000 bank guarantee upon renewal of the existing work permits. (Note: this provision applies only to firms; it does not apply on domestic labour).

Note that health insurance is not covered by this policy.

### How to get the bank guarantee refund and register in the new insurance policy?

Firms can reclaim the bank guarantee money if the:

- work permit of the worker is cancelled, and the firm can provide proof of his departure from the UAE
- worker is deceased and has either been repatriated to his home country or buried in the UAE
- worker has been transferred to the sponsorship of a new employer.

Additionally, firms can reclaim the bank guarantee in any other situation in which the employer proves that the worker’s permit has been cancelled and all his entitlements have been paid.

The insurance document and bank guarantee refund can be processed and obtained from business services centres  and domestic labour recruitments centres  and also through the [MoHRE app](https://workinuae.ae/en/Apps)
available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ae.gov.mol)
and [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/ae/app/mohre-uae/id807379317).

Firms can either reclaim the bank guarantee money when an employment contract is terminated or when a work permit is renewed. However, they must have purchased the new insurance policy before the refund is paid out. Note that any company with violations such as failing to pay salaries in the last six months will not be eligible for a refund.

  .

### Individual labour disputes

Key regulations for settling individual labour disputes

**Legislation for the settlement of individual labor disputes**

The UAE’s laws guarantee the rights of both: the employer and the employee, especially in the event of a labour dispute between them. Both parties have the option of filing a labor complaint with Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MOHRE) through a few easy steps. The complaints will then be examined and settled amicably or referred to the judiciary, if an amicable settlement is not possible.

**Laws regulating labour complaints in the UAE**

The following laws provide for labour complaints in the UAE

1.  Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021 on the Regulation of Labour Relations in the Private Sector
2.  Cabinet Resolution No. 1 of 2022 on the Implementation of Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021 Regarding the Regulation of Labour Relations and
3.  Ministerial Resolution No. 47 of 2022 on the Settlement of Labor Disputes and Complaints Procedures.

Article 54 of the above Decree Law provides that if there is a dispute between the employer and the worker or if any of them is entitled to obtain any of the resulting rights of them, he shall submit a request to the ministry, which shall examine the request and take steps to settle the dispute amicably.

If a friendly settlement is not possible within 14 days from the date of application, the ministry shall refer the dispute to the competent court and provide a memorandum including a summary of the dispute, arguments of both parties and the ministry’s recommendation.

Penalties or administrative actions may be taken against the establishment or the employer, only after settling or resolving the dispute as per the laws.

The ministry may for a maximum period of two months not use its right to direct the employer to pay the worker his wages, if the dispute causes the suspension of the worker’s wages payment according to the Implementing Regulation.

However, the Minister may impose other administrative actions or measures on the establishment, in order to avoid the existing individual dispute from becoming a collective labour dispute.

2.  **Cabinet Resolution No. 1 of 2022 on the Implementation of Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021 Regarding the Regulation of Labour Relations**

Article 31 of the [Cabinet resolution No. 1 of 2022 on the Implementation of Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021 on the Regulation of Labour Relations](https://www.mohre.gov.ae/en/laws-and-regulations/laws.aspx)
provides that: Every worker whose complaint has been referred to the court by MoHRE, must quickly file a case and request an amendment of his employment status. The Minister may issue the necessary resolutions regulating the status of the worker and the establishment after referring the complaint to the judiciary. The worker shall have the right to claim two months’ wages if he continues to work for the employer while the referred labour dispute is in the court.

3.  **Ministerial Resolution No. 47 of 2022 Regarding the Settlement of Labor Disputes and Complaints Procedures**

According to [Ministerial Resolution No. 47 of 2022 Regarding the Settlement of Labour Disputes and Complaints Procedures](https://u.ae/-/media/Information-and-services/Jobs/Ministerial-Resolution-No-47-of-2022-2.pdf) (PDF, 350 KB) every worker whose labour complaint has been referred to the Labour Court must:

1.  register the labour complaint with the competent court within a maximum period of 14 days from the date of approving the referral to the judiciary
2.  refrain from working for another employer without obtaining a temporary work permit from the Ministry
3.  submit a request to cancel the original work permit within 14 days from the date of issuance of the final judgment in the labour lawsuit, in the event of termination of the work relationship between the two parties
4.  apply for a temporary work permit with a new employer during the process of the labour case, except when he was reported absent by his/her employer.

In cases where the labour complaint leads to the worker's cessation of work, his/her work permit will be cancelled after 6 months from the date of referring the complaint to the labour court.

4**.** **Ministerial Resolution No. 782 of 2023 Regulating the Process for Resolving Individual Labour Complaints**

According to [Ministerial Resolution No. 782 of 2023 Regulating the Process for Resolving Individual Labour Complaints](https://u.ae/-/media/Mohre-2024/Ministerial-Resolution-No-782-of-2023-Regulating-the-Process-for-Resolving-Individual-Labour-Complai.pdf) (PDF, 196 KB), MOHRE can make a final decision in labour disputes if:

1.  the amount claimed is less than AED 50,000 or
2.  the parties reach an amicable settlement, regardless of the claim’s value.

However, if the disputed claim is more than AED 50,000 and the parties cannot agree on a resolution, MOHRE must refer the case to the judiciary.

- **Provisions as per the UAE Labour Law**

Article 54 of the Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021 on the Regulation of Labour Relations in the Private Sector, the ‘[UAE Labour Law’](https://www.mohre.gov.ae/en/laws-and-regulations/laws.aspx)
, provides that:

- labour cases referred to the court must be accompanied with a memo giving a summary of the dispute, evidence of both parties and the comments of the labour department concerned
- the competent court will, within three days from the date of receiving the request, fix a hearing for the claim and notify the two parties.

According to Article 10, no claim for any rights due will be heard after one year from the date of violation.

Additionally, Article 55 of the UAE Labour Law exempts workers or their heirs from paying judicial fees at all stages of litigation and execution, for claims less than AED 100,000.

**Labour Claims and Advisory Call Centre**

Workers can seek assistance for any labour-related grievances or legal matters by contacting MoHRE’s 'Labour Claims and Advisory Call Centre' on the toll-free number 80084.

### Laws and initiatives to protect workers from foreign countries

The UAE is a [significant recipient of foreign labour](https://www.mohre.gov.ae/en/data-library/statistical-report.aspx)
. As a member of the [International Labour Organization](https://www.ilo.org/global/lang--en/index.htm)
(ILO), the [Arab Labour Organization](https://alolabor.org/)
and other labour-focused multilateral organisations, the UAE seeks to work transparently and objectively with regard to its labour obligations.

The UAE has re-evaluated every aspect of working in the country from recruitment to housing, ensuring that all workers from foreign countries are treated respectfully and able to report instances of mistreatment easily. Charging recruitment fees to prospective employees is illegal in the UAE. The confiscation of workers' passports is prohibited and workers do not require their employer's permission to leave the country.

Other reforms for workers from foreign countries include:

### Efforts to enhance work conditions for migrant workers and nationals

The UAE made enormous efforts to enhance the work conditions for all employees and create job opportunities. Some of these efforts are:

- In 2015, the UAE government injected AED 300 billion to [foster a knowledge economy](https://u.ae/en/about-the-uae/economy#economy-and-innovation)
  , driven by innovation to prepare the UAE for a world after oil
- It developed several [strategies](https://u.ae/en/about-the-uae/strategies-initiatives-and-awards)
   to diversify its national income based on a sustainable economy and to increase work opportunities.

The UAE adopted Emiratisation programmes which mandate the inclusion of Emiratis in the job sector, particularly in the private sector. The latest was [NAFIS](https://nafis.gov.ae/)
, a comprehensive federal programme which includes reforms and financial incentives to drive work opportunities for both: young and experienced Emiratis in the private sector.

### The Savings scheme – a voluntary and alternative end-of-service benefits scheme

The Savings scheme is an alternative and optional scheme to the existing end of service benefits system. Under this scheme, employees could invest their end of service benefits in reputable funds, enabling them to receive returns upon completion of their service.

Employers choosing to participate in the scheme will need to contribute monthly to an investment fund. These contributions will entitle beneficiaries (employees) to receive the allocated basic subscription amount, along with any investment returns generated, in place of their end of service benefits.

**Objectives of the scheme**

The Savings scheme aims to protect employees from inflation, default and bankruptcy. It also aims employees to benefit from investing in various economic activities in the UAE.

**Investment options**

The scheme offers a variety of investment options, which include:

- Sharia-compliant funds
- a capital guarantee portfolio option that offers a risk-free investment, for unskilled workers
- and various other investment portfolios that carry varying levels of financial risk based on expected return.

[Daman Investments End of Service Programme](https://daman.ae/end-of-service/)
is approved as one of the investment funds under the Savings scheme. Learn more about [Daman Investments End of Service Programme](https://u.ae/-/media/Documents-2024/damaninsurancebroucherenaspx.pdf)
(PDF, 1.63 MB).

**Scope**

The scheme applies to employers and employees in the private sector and the free zones.

**Participation in the scheme**

Employers who wish to participate in this alternative system must [submit a request to MoHRE.](https://www.mohre.gov.ae/en/services/services-directory.aspx)

Employers must select and contract with one of the investment funds licensed by [Securities and Commodities Authority](https://www.sca.gov.ae/en/home.aspx)
(SCA) to provide these services. They must also determine which employee categories and levels should be included in the scheme.

Companies must discontinue the use of the current end of service benefits system for employees who are selected to participate in this scheme.

Once the employees are chosen, participation in the fund becomes mandatory, and employers must ensure that the employees' entitlements from the previous period are preserved.

**Basic subscription fee**

Employers’ contribution to the investment fund for full-time employees is as follows:

- 5.83 per cent of their employees’ monthly basic salary if the employee has not completed five years of service
- 8.33 per cent if the employee has served more than five years.

Subscriptions must be transferred into the investment fund within 15 days of the beginning of each calendar month.

**Additional voluntary subscription**

In addition to the basic subscription made by the employers, subscribed employees may contribute voluntarily a percentage of their salary or an additional amount, either in instalments or as lump sum.

The voluntary contribution will be deducted from their salaries, provided it does not exceed 25 per cent of the total annual salary.

For more information about subscription in the Savings scheme and fees for other work patterns, refer to [Ministerial Resolution No. 668 of 2023 Regarding Subscription under the Alternative End of Service Benefits System](https://u.ae/-/media/Documents-2nd-half-2023/Ministerial-Resolution-No-668-of-2023-Regarding-Subscription-Under-the-Alternarive-EndofService-Bene.pdf)
– (PDF, 140 KB).

**Entitlements of the employee**

The employee is entitled to all basic subscription amounts paid by the employer and any returns resulting from it during the subscription period, within 14 days after the termination of employment. He also has the option to continue investing in the scheme.

Employees can withdraw part or all of the voluntary contributions or their investment returns at any time during their employment, in accordance with terms set forth by the fund manager.

**Supervision of the scheme**

MoHRE and SCA monitor, supervise and inspect the alternative system in accordance with the applicable legislations.

MoHRE is responsible for receiving labour complaints related to this alternative system and investigating complaints and violations discovered during inspections.

SCA will address complaints regarding the performance of the service providers of the investment funds.

Financial [free zones authorities](https://www.moec.gov.ae/en/free-zones)
are responsible for supervising and resolving complaints regarding the alternative end of service benefits system under their jurisdiction.

### End of service benefits under full time contracts

- **UAE nationals**

End of service benefits for Emiratis working in the private sector will be in accordance with the legislation regulating the [pensions and social securities in the UAE](https://www.gpssa.gov.ae/en/Pages/default.aspx#/#/)
.

As per [Article 51 of the UAE Labour Law](https://www.mohre.gov.ae/en/laws-and-regulations/laws.aspx)
, end of service benefits for foreign workers working in the private sector will be as follows:

- The worker is entitled to a gratuity for the served fraction of a year, provided that he completes one year of continuous service.
- The end of service gratuity is calculated on basis of last wage which the worker was entitled to, namely the basic salary. Hence, it will not include allowances such as housing, conveyance, utilities, furniture etc.
- If the worker owes any money to the employer, the employer may deduct the amount from the worker's gratuity.
- All end of service entitlements must be paid within 14 days from the contract’s end date.

**Calculations for gratuity pay**

A worker who has spent one year or more in continuous service shall be entitled to an end of service gratuity upon the termination of his service. The days of absence from work without pay shall not be included in the calculation of the period of service and the gratuity shall be calculated as follows:

- If a worker has served for less than 1 year, he is not entitled to any gratuity pay.
- If a worker has served for more than 1 year but less than 5 years, he is entitled to full gratuity pay based on 21 days' salary for each year of work.
- If a worker has served more than 5 years, he is entitled to full gratuity of 30 days' salary for each year of work following the first five years.

In all cases, the total gratuity shall not exceed the wage of two years.

### Under other types of employment

As per Article 30 of  the [Cabinet Resolution No. 1 of 2022](https://www.mohre.gov.ae/en/laws-and-regulations/laws.aspx) on the Implementation of the Regulation of Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021 Regarding the Regulation of Labour Relations, the end of service benefits for workers in part time contracts or other types of work arrangements are calculated pursuant to the following:

![Article 30](https://u.ae/-/media/Images-2023/Images-June-2023/Article-30-labour-resolution-English.PNG)

The number of working hours in the employment contract per year divided by the number of working hours in the full time contract per year multiplied by 100 equal to the percentage on which the end of service benefit should be calculated. Then this percentage should be multiplied by the value of the end of service benefit due for the full time contract.

Either party can terminate an employment contract provided he/she serves notice and complies with other legal consequences of the termination. Read when either party can end a contract without notice. It would be considered arbitrary dismissal if the employer terminates an employee because the latter filed a legitimate complaint with MoHRE or a lawsuit against the employer.

### Situations in which an employment contract may be terminated

Following are the situations in which an employment contract may be terminated as per Article 42 of the [Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021 on the Regulation of Labour Relations in the Private Sector, the ‘UAE Labour Law’](https://www.mohre.gov.ae/en/laws-and-regulations/laws.aspx)

9.  if the worker fails to fulfil the conditions for renewing the work permit for any reason beyond the control of the employer.

**Notice period of termination**

Article 43 provides that either party in the employment contract can terminate the contract for any ‘legitimate reason’, provided that:

1.  a written notification is given to the other party and
2.  the terminating party serves a notice of 1 month (30 days) to 3 months (90 days).

**Additionally, the following** provisions must be adhered to:

1.  work as agreed upon in the contract must be performed during the notice period
2.  the worker is entitled to his full wage as per the contract, for the notice period
3.  the party who fails to serve the notice period must pay the other a ‘notice period’ allowance, which is equal to the worker’s wage for the full notice period or in proportion to the remaining period. The allowance for the notice period is calculated according to the last wage received by the worker.
4.  In the event that the employer terminates the contract, the worker is entitled to an unpaid leave of one day per week during the notice period to search for another job.

Note that the notice period may be reduced or exempted on mutual agreement between the two parties, with no infringement of any parties’ rights.

### Termination of contract without notice by the employer

Article 44 of the [UAE Labour Law](https://www.mohre.gov.ae/en/laws-and-regulations/laws.aspx)
mentions that an employer may terminate the services of the employee without notice, if the latter:

1.  adopts a false identity or submits forged documents or certificates
2.  commits an error causing substantial material loss to the employer or if he deliberately damages the properties of the employer and acknowledged the same. Note that the employer must inform MoHRE about the incident within seven working days from having knowledge of the same.
3.  violates instructions concerning safety of the workers and the place of business provided that such instructions were displayed in writing at conspicuous places or verbally informed to an illiterate employee
4.  fails to perform his basic duties under the employment contract and persists in violating them despite warning him twice of dismissal, if the same is repeated
5.  divulges any secrets of the establishment resulting in losses or a missed opportunity to the employer, or achieving a personal benefit for self

If an employee believes that he has been dismissed illegally, he can complain to [Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation](http://www.mohre.gov.ae/en/home.aspx)
. The ministry will try to solve the issue amicably. If an amicable settlement is not reached, the case will be referred to the respective court.

If arbitrary dismissal is proven, the court will order the employer to pay a compensation to the employee. The court will assess the value of compensation taking into account the type of work, the extent of damage caused to the employee and the duration of his employment. In all cases, the amount of compensation must not exceed the wage of the employee for a period of three months, calculated on the basis of the last wage he was entitled to.

In addition to compensation, the employee can claim his gratuity, notice period dues or any other unpaid dues he is entitled to, from his employer.

### Emiratisation targets in the private sector

**Nafis  
**The Emirati Human Resources Competitiveness Council, ‘Nafis’ implements national initiatives aimed at increasing Emiratisation in the private sector. The council supports citizens in the private sector by increasing their competitiveness and providing this sector with Emirati skills.

The council aims to get 75,000 citizens into the private sector over the next five years. It also offers many initiatives to empower Emirati cadres and motivate private companies to attract Emirati talent.

**Rate of Emiratisation -** (Companies with 50 or more workers)

The Cabinet approved a decision to raise Emiratisation rates to 2 per cent annually for skilled jobs in private sector establishments with 50 or more employees and to achieve an overall rate of increase by 10 per cent by 2026. This is accompanied by granting incentives to institutions that perform qualitatively in the training and employment of citizens.

To support the commitment to achieve the above employment targets for nationals, non-compliant companies will have to pay an amount of AED 6,000 monthly, starting from January 2023, for every citizen who has not been employed. The amount will be paid through the digital systems of Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE), provided that the value of the monthly contributions increases by AED 1,000 annually until 2026. To monitor the implementation of these decisions in the labour market, MoHRE is working with the Cabinet Secretariat to measure the indicator of Emiratisation in the private sector.

**Expansion of the Emiratisation targets -** (Companies with 20 to 49 workers)

Starting in 2024, private sector companies with a workforce of 20 to 49 workers will be required to hire at least one UAE citizen and from 2025, they would be required to hire at least two Emirati citizens. Previously, this mandate applied only to companies with 50 or more employees.

This requirement is applicable to companies operating in the following 14 sectors:

1.  information and communications
2.  financial and insurance activities
3.  real estate activities
4.  professional, scientific and technical activities
5.  administrative and support services
6.  education
7.  healthcare and social work activities
8.  arts and entertainment
9.  mining and quarrying industry
10. manufacturing

### Renewing your residence visa

Your sponsor must renew your residence visa before it expires. A renewed visa will let you continue living legally in the UAE without incurring fines or facing legal consequences for the same. UAE residents are granted longer flexible grace periods that reach up to 6 months (according to resident cateogry) to stay in the country after the residence permit is cancelled or expired.

The [ICP has standardised](https://gulfnews.com/uae/uae-overstaying-fees-reduces-for-visitors-increases-for-residents-1.91798598)
the overstaying fines in the UAE. According to the new rules, visit, tourist and residence visa overstaying fees have standardised at AED 50 per day. Those overstaying on a residency visa will have to pay AED 50 each day (AED 50 per day instead of AED 25).

Remember that when the visa expires, your Emirates ID card issued by the ICP also expires.

If there is a need to renew your residence visa a few months earlier (one to six months) for travelling reasons, you must first take special permission and approval from ICP.

### Cancelling your residence visa

If you a have a residence visa sponsored either by a family member or by your employer, and you decide to leave the country permanently, your residence visa must be cancelled officially.

Normally, only the sponsor can cancel your residence visa. You cannot process the application on your own.

If a company decides to cancel an employment visa of its employee, it must first approach [Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation](https://www.mohre.gov.ae/en/home.aspx)
with an application to cancel the employee’s labour contract and labour card. The employee must also sign this application. Then, the employer should apply to ICP for visa cancellation.

The company must also cancel the work permit. For this, it must submit a letter signed by the employee stating that he has already received all his wages and end of services benefits to Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation.

An individual sponsoring his/her spouse, children and other dependents must cancel the dependents’ visas before he cancels his/her own.

**How to cancel your residence visa?**

There are two ways to cancel your visa. You can do it either through a registered typing centre or online.

- **Registered** typing **centre**s

  The sponsor may visit any [typing office registered by ICP](https://icp.gov.ae/en/typing-offices/)
  in the respective emirate. The typing office will fill the cancellation form on your behalf and process it online through ICP.

- **Online**

Alternatively, the sponsor may process the cancellation [online through the ICP website](https://icp.gov.ae/en/service/cancel-residency-permit/)

- report immediately to the competent police station, in the geographic location of the firm, any work injury or occupational disease.

Compensation for work injuries and occupational diseases

An employer is obligated to treat and compensate an injured worker for any work-related illness or injury. The compensation is paid according to the provisions stipulated in Article 37 of [Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021 Regarding the Regulation of Employment Relationship](https://www.mohre.gov.ae/handlers/download.ashx?YXNzZXQ9NjU5MA%3d%3d)
, and its amendments (PDF, 918 KB).

The worker receives compensation within a maximum period of 10 days after the release of the medical report indicating the percentage of disability as illustrated in the schedules annexed to [Cabinet Resolution No. 33 of 2022 Concerning Work injuries and Occupational diseases](https://www.mohre.gov.ae/handlers/download.ashx?YXNzZXQ9Njc3Mg%3d%3d)
