# Employment and training of minors

Children below the age of 15 are prohibited from being employed in the UAE. Those between the ages of 15 and 18 years are allowed to work, subject to several conditions, and after getting juvenile work permits. Students aged 15 years and above are allowed to work and get trained at operating establishments on the condition of a written contract.

### Legal provisions

According to Article 5 of the [UAE’s Labour Law](https://u.ae/-/media/Documents-2022/New-Labour-Law--no-33-of-2021-Ar.pdf)
, it is prohibited to employ juveniles, those between the age of 15 and 18 years. Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation does not issue work permits to juveniles, whether Emiratis or expatriate residents.

On the other hand, the law allows juveniles to work with an official work permit issued by MoHRE, provided that the employer wishing to employ the youth meets certain conditions, which include:

1.  A clear coloured photo with a white background
2.  A written consent signed by the juvenile's guardian or custodian
3.  A certificate of fitness for the work required, issued by the medical authority
4.  A copy of the passport and a copy of a valid residence permit
5.  The employment contract approved by the ministry and containing the signature of the employer and the employee.

**Terms and conditions:**

According to the law, juveniles may not be employed at night, in industrial projects, or in work that is dangerous or harmful to health. Read the other terms and conditions for hiring juveniles.

1.  The work should not be such that is forbidden to be carried out by juveniles.
2.  The work for which the juvenile will be hired, must be in line with the activities of the establishment.
3.  The establishment's licence must be valid and there must be no violations leading to suspension of the activity in accordance with the legal regulations.
4.  The application for a permit must be submitted by the legally authorised signatory on behalf of the establishment.
5.  The juvenile to be employed should not be holding a valid work permit.

Note that:

1.  no insurance or bank guarantee is required for the permit to be issued.
2.  an electronic quota is not required to obtain a juvenile work permit.

Read more about the UAE’s system for employing minors [in Article 4 of the Cabinet Resolution No. 1 of 2022](https://www.mohre.gov.ae/en/laws-and-regulations/laws.aspx)
on the Implementation of the Regulation of Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021 Regarding the Regulation of Labour Relations.

The UAE is a party to the following international human rights treaties on children:

- [Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC)](http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/crc.aspx)
  (1997)
- [ILO Conventions](http://www.ilo.org/global/standards/introduction-to-international-labour-standards/conventions-and-recommendations/lang--en/index.htm) on the subjects of working hours, forced labour, labour inspections, night work for women, equal pay, the minimum age for employment and the worst forms of child labour
- [The Convention against Transnational Organised Crime: the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children](https://www.unodc.org/unodc/treaties/CTOC/) (The Palermo Protocol)
- [The Arab Charter of Human Rights](https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/551368?ln=en)
  .

### Training and employing students

The latest is [Ministerial Decree No. 519 of 2018 on Regulations and Conditions of Training and Employment of Students (PDF, 250 KB).](https://www.mohre.gov.ae/handlers/download.ashx?YXNzZXQ9NjU0NQ%3d%3d)

According to this resolution, any establishment may train students aged 15 years and above, on the condition of a written contract. The contract must include:

- the areas of training
- duration of the training period
- weekly and other holidays
- the value of the bonus, if any, and any privileges granted to the trainee.

Additionally, any establishment may recruit students aged 15 years and above during their academic holidays, for maximum three consecutive months each time. An employment contract must clarify the nature of work, its duration, the wage, weekly holiday and the number of daily working hours.

**Conditions for employing or training students**

In addition to the general conditions listed in Article 5 of the [UAE Labour Law](https://www.mohre.gov.ae/en/laws-and-regulations/laws.aspx)
, other conditions include:

- proof of the ‘student’ status
- a valid UAE residence visa for expatriate students
- a copy of Emirates ID
- in case of training, a ‘no objection’ certificate from the educational institute in which the student is enrolled.

Before coming to the UAE, make sure that your passport is authentic and valid for at least six months.

Foreigners planning to work in the UAE must know that they cannot work on visit visas or tourist visas. They need legitimate [work/residency visa/permit to be able to live and work legally in the UAE.](https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/visa-and-emirates-id/residence-visas)
The employer needs to procure the work and residency permits. Working without first obtaining the proper visa status is illegal and can lead to penalties and legal liability. The penalties apply to both: the employer and the employee.

### Health screening

Foreigners [planning to work in the UAE will need to undergo medical tests](https://www.ehs.gov.ae/en/services/services-directory/pre-employment-fitness-screening)
at government approved health centres in the UAE. Candidates will be tested for communicable diseases/conditions such as those related to HIV and/or TB. Those found to be HIV positive or having tuberculosis will be deported immediately by the UAE authorities. Hence, if you suspect that you suffer from a communicable disease it is advisable to get tested in your home country first.

As per [Cabinet Resolution passed in 2016](https://uaecabinet.ae/en/details/news/dubai-ruler-issues-cabinet-decree-to-amending-expatriates-medical-examination-system)
, all resident expatriates while renewing their residence visas have to undergo TB screening. Those found with scars or active TB or found having drug-resistant TB will be issued a conditional fitness certificate and be issued residence visa for one year. They will then have to undergo treatment in the UAE.

### Certifications attestation

In the UAE, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) [attests documents digitally;](https://www.mofa.gov.ae/en/Services/Attestation)
while outside the UAE, it attests them through its [embassies and consulates](https://www.mofa.gov.ae/en/Missions/UAE-Missions-Abroad).

Document attestation is a procedure that confirms the validity of seals and signatures on documents and instruments, regardless of where they originate.

Types of documents attested

MoFA attests various individual affairs’ documents including birth, death and marriage certificates; as well as, commercial documents such as contracts and agreements, minutes of meeting, trademark registrations and company closure documents.

Steps for getting documents attested

**For documents issued in the UAE**

For documents issued in the UAE, the original document needs to be attested first by the relevant government entity. However, this is not required for digitally issued or electronically attested documents.

**For documents issued outside the UAE**

For documents issued outside the UAE, the original document should be attested first by Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the issuing country. Afterwards, the document can be attested by a UAE Embassy or Consulate in that country by applying through the UAE’s MoFA online channels.

If there is no UAE mission in a particular country, applicants may [contact MoFA](https://www.mofa.gov.ae/en/Contact-us)
for assistance.

Customers can process all transactions related to attestation services through [MoFA’s official website](https://www.mofa.gov.ae/)
and its app UAEMOFA available on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mob.uae&hl=en)
and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/uae-mofa/id540714559)
. Upon the approval of the transaction, applicants in the UAE can send the original documents to MoFA via courier and receive them back attested, through the same courier service.

# Job offers and the employment process

The employment process in the private sector involves receiving a formal job offer, signing the employment contract, receiving the work permit and then, receiving the work visa. After the signing of the contract, the employer is not allowed to alter or replace any provisions of the offer letter unless the employee consents to it, and such changes are within the scope of law.

### Related eServices

Find related [eServices for the employers and employees](https://www.mohre.gov.ae/en/services.aspx)
on the eServices page of Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation.

### Receiving a job offer

The employment process in the private sector involves receiving a formal job offer, signing the employment contract, receiving a work permit and a work visa.

The offer letter contains important details of the job and an annex that summarises the most important aspects of the UAE Labour Law. Both parties must sign these documents.

As per labour reform regulations effective 2016, an offer letter made to a foreign worker becomes legally binding after it is signed by both parties. An offer letter to a foreign worker signed by both parties becomes a legal contract.

Hence, after signing, the employer is not allowed to alter or replace any provisions of the offer letter unless such changes have the consent of both the employer and the employee, are within the scope of law and do not compromise the rights of the employee.

The employer must ensure that the employee has read the offer letter and understood it. If it is proved that a worker did not go through the annexes before signing the labour contract, the employer will be fined AED 20,000 for submitting incorrect data to MoHRE.

If the employee is in the UAE, he must sign the offer letter before the employer can seek MoHRE's preliminary approval for his employment.

Employers must disclose the terms of the offer letter to MoHRE. A copy of the offer letter is stored in the MoHRE's database. Employees are issued work permits based on these offer letters.

### Signing the contract

The employment contract is a document signed between the employer and the employee in which the latter undertakes to serve the employer and works under his management against an agreed fee paid by the employer.

The employment contract should be based on the offer letter signed by both parties and must be submitted to MoHRE within 14 days of the employee's arrival in the UAE based on the employment entry permit or from the date of status change (if you are in a status which allows you to transfer your visa; i.e. not having violated any law).

**Language of employment contract**

In January 2016, MoHRE approved a third language to be added on the job offer, labour contract and annexure.

In addition to Arabic and English, employees can choose from the following 9 languages: Bengali, Chinese, Dari, Hindi, Malayalam, Nepalese, Sinhalese, Tamil and Urdu.

This applies to workers coming from outside and those residing in the UAE that are seeking a new job, or moving from one company to another.

### Efforts to enhance work conditions for migrant workers and nationals

The UAE made enormous efforts to enhance the work conditions for all employees and create job opportunities. Some of these efforts are:

- In 2015, the UAE government injected AED 300 billion to [foster a knowledge economy](https://u.ae/en/about-the-uae/economy#economy-and-innovation)
  , driven by innovation to prepare the UAE for a world after oil
- It developed several [strategies](https://u.ae/en/about-the-uae/strategies-initiatives-and-awards)
   to diversify its national income based on a sustainable economy and to increase work opportunities.

The UAE adopted Emiratisation programmes which mandate the inclusion of Emiratis in the job sector, particularly in the private sector. The latest was [NAFIS](https://nafis.gov.ae/)
, a comprehensive federal programme which includes reforms and financial incentives to drive work opportunities for both: young and experienced Emiratis in the private sector.

A male or female resident can sponsor his/her son/s until he is 25. Sons of determination (those with special needs) can be sponsored with no restrictions with regard to his/ their age/s.

**Sponsoring newborns**

For babies born in the UAE, a residence visa must be applied for, within 120 days of its birth to avoid getting fines.

# Working for two employers at one time

The UAE's Labour Law permits working for two employers. This page covers provisions for people who live in the UAE on work visa and family visa.

### General provisions

Since 2010, the UAE's Labour Law made provisions which allow an employee to have a part-time job along with a full-time one subject to certain conditions. The employee can work part-time after getting the work permit from MoHRE.

The fee for part-time work permit includes an application fee of AED 100 and an approval fee of AED 500.

As per Federal Decree Law No. 2 of 2007, if an expatriate is caught working for another company without an official permit, then a fine of AED 50,000 will be applied to the hiring company, in addition to other penalties in case of repeating the offence.

### For people on a work visa

Emiratis, other GCC nationals and expatriate employees who are living in the UAE on a work visa, can take up a second job, upon getting a part-time work permit from MoHRE, which is valid for one year.

Part-time work permit holders are allowed to work in another company at the same time as working in the current company on a part-time basis for less than eight hours per day.

### For people on family visa

Those who live in the UAE on a family visa can take up a second job after getting a part-time work permit with an NOC from the sponsor. Such work permits can be issued to men and women between 18 and 65 years of age.

### Part-time contract system

In 2018, [Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation](http://www.mohre.gov.ae/en/home.aspx)
 (MoHRE) implemented a new rule which allows the companies to recruit skilled workers from inside the country or from abroad under part-time contract system. These types of contracts are limited only to skilled workers, namely holders of university degrees or higher and those who completed two or three years diploma in any technical or scientific field.

Under this new system, part-time contract employees can take several part-time jobs without the approval of the original or other secondary employers; however, they are obligated to take permit from the MoHRE.

# Preparing to work

Foreigners wishing to work in the UAE must make sure that their passports are valid for at least six months. Degree certificates obtained from outside the UAE need to be attested. All foreigners will be tested for communicable diseases/conditions such as those related to HIV and/or TB.

### Passport and visas

Before coming to the UAE, make sure that your passport is authentic and valid for at least six months.

Foreigners planning to work in the UAE must know that they cannot work on visit visas or tourist visas. They need legitimate [work/residency visa/permit to be able to live and work legally in the UAE.](https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/visa-and-emirates-id/residence-visas)
The employer needs to procure the work and residency permits. Working without first obtaining the proper visa status is illegal and can lead to penalties and legal liability. The penalties apply to both: the employer and the employee.

### Health screening

Foreigners [planning to work in the UAE will need to undergo medical tests](https://www.ehs.gov.ae/en/services/services-directory/pre-employment-fitness-screening)
at government approved health centres in the UAE. Candidates will be tested for communicable diseases/conditions such as those related to HIV and/or TB. Those found to be HIV positive or having tuberculosis will be deported immediately by the UAE authorities. Hence, if you suspect that you suffer from a communicable disease it is advisable to get tested in your home country first.

As per [Cabinet Resolution passed in 2016](https://uaecabinet.ae/en/details/news/dubai-ruler-issues-cabinet-decree-to-amending-expatriates-medical-examination-system)
, all resident expatriates while renewing their residence visas have to undergo TB screening. Those found with scars or active TB or found having drug-resistant TB will be issued a conditional fitness certificate and be issued residence visa for one year. They will then have to undergo treatment in the UAE.

### Certifications attestation

In the UAE, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) [attests documents digitally;](https://www.mofa.gov.ae/en/Services/Attestation)
while outside the UAE, it attests them through its [embassies and consulates](https://www.mofa.gov.ae/en/Missions/UAE-Missions-Abroad).

Document attestation is a procedure that confirms the validity of seals and signatures on documents and instruments, regardless of where they originate.

Types of documents attested

MoFA attests various individual affairs’ documents including birth, death and marriage certificates; as well as, commercial documents such as contracts and agreements, minutes of meeting, trademark registrations and company closure documents.

Steps for getting documents attested

**For documents issued in the UAE**

For documents issued in the UAE, the original document needs to be attested first by the relevant government entity. However, this is not required for digitally issued or electronically attested documents.

**For documents issued outside the UAE**

For documents issued outside the UAE, the original document should be attested first by Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the issuing country. Afterwards, the document can be attested by a UAE Embassy or Consulate in that country by applying through the UAE’s MoFA online channels.

If there is no UAE mission in a particular country, applicants may [contact MoFA](https://www.mofa.gov.ae/en/Contact-us)
for assistance.

Customers can process all transactions related to attestation services through [MoFA’s official website](https://www.mofa.gov.ae/)
and its app UAEMOFA available on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mob.uae&hl=en)
and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/uae-mofa/id540714559)
. Upon the approval of the transaction, applicants in the UAE can send the original documents to MoFA via courier and receive them back attested, through the same courier service.

Some professions, such as that of a lawyer licensed to appear before the judge and carry out the defence can be practised only by UAE nationals. Read about [Emiratisation](https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/jobs/emiratisation)
.

# GCC Nationals working in the private sector

GCC nationals working in the private sector shall be treated as UAE nationals in terms of all employment procedures. GCC nationals employed in the UAE are entitled to pension in accordance with the schemes established in their home countries.

## Implementing a remote work system in the federal government in normal situations

The UAE Government will implement the remote work system, on a full time or part time basis, even during ordinary situations. The new remote work system will continue alongside the traditional work system, wherein the employees will be executing their work at the entities’ premises. It will be for current and future Emirati employees who are eligible to work remotely based on set criteria.

In April 2020, the UAE Government issued [Cabinet Resolution No. 27 for 2020 Regarding Remote Work System in the Federal Government](https://u.ae/-/media/Information-and-services/Jobs/Cabinet-Resolution-No-27-for-2020-Regarding-Remote-Work-System-in-the-Federal-Government.pdf)
(PDF-365 KB), in which it was decided to implement the remote work system, on a full time or part time basis, even during ordinary situations.

The new remote work system will continue alongside the traditional work system, wherein the employees will be executing their work at the entities’ premises.

This resolution applies to current and future Emirati employees who are eligible to work remotely as determined by the federal entities, in coordination with [Federal Authority for Government Human Resources](https://www.fahr.gov.ae/Portal/en/home.aspx)
(FAHR) and in accordance with the human resources procedures and electronic systems approved by the Federal Government.

The resolution mentions a set of criteria that ministries and federal entities must observe to determine if a job can be done remotely. Jobs allowed for remote working must meet the following conditions:

- the job must be of divisible nature
- it can be automated
- its inputs can be handled through electronic systems.

Only those employees would be selected for working remotely who:

- occupy a job that can be performed remotely
- are sincere, abide by quality and accuracy of work and confidentiality of information
- have attained performance expectations, at least up to the last performance appraisal
- have not been subject to any administrative penalties for breach of [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.fahr.gov.ae/Portal/en/legislations-and-guides/systems/professional-conduct-document.aspx)
  for civil service.

# Work patterns in the federal sector

A federal sector employee may be under on the following work patterns: full time, part time, temporary or flexible. Work may be done on site, remotely or in a hybrid mode.

---

In accordance with the ‘[Human Resources Law in the Federal Government](https://www.fahr.gov.ae/en/legislations-guides/the-law-regulations/human-resources-law-in-the-federal-government/)
’, the UAE recognises the following models of work patterns:

- Full time - Under this system, an employee works only for a single federal entity on a full-time basis, whether at the workplace, remotely or in a hybrid work mode. This arrangement is governed by the terms of the employment contract or any agreement between the federal entity and the employee.
- Part time - Under this system, an employee works for a federal entity for a specific number of working hours or days, whether at the workplace, remotely or in a hybrid work mode. The terms of employment are outlined in the employment contract or any agreement between the federal entity and the employee.
- Temporary work - Under this system, an employee works on a specific assignment and the contract ends upon its completion.
- Flexible work - Under this system, working hours or days may change based on the entity’s volume of work, and economic and operational variables. The employee may work for the employer at variable times according to work conditions and requirements.

Article 9 of the [Executive Regulations](https://www.fahr.gov.ae/Portal/en/legislations-and-guides/the-cabinet-resolutions/executive-regulation-of-the-law.aspx)
of the Human Resources Law in the Federal Government outlines the types of work approved in the federal entities, as follows:

- on-site work, at the premises of the entity
- remote work from anywhere in the UAE
- remote work from abroad
- intensive working hours (compressed work week)
- hybrid work.

The benefits and salaries of the employees vary depending on the employment pattern, the type of work contracted, and the mechanisms and benefits of the contract.

The federal entity has the authority to modify the employee’s type of work during the term of the contract, or upon its termination, in line with the interest and requirements of the work, and in accordance with the conditions and rules stipulated in the Executive Regulations and other regulations issued by the Cabinet.

Refer to Articles 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17 in the [Executive Regulations](https://www.fahr.gov.ae/Portal/en/legislations-and-guides/the-cabinet-resolutions/executive-regulation-of-the-law.aspx)
of Human Resources Law in the Federal Government, for more information about the employment options.

# End of service benefits for workers in the private sector

### The Savings scheme – a voluntary and alternative end-of-service benefits scheme

The Savings scheme is an alternative and optional scheme to the existing end of service benefits system. Under this scheme, employees could invest their end of service benefits in reputable funds, enabling them to receive returns upon completion of their service.

Employers choosing to participate in the scheme will need to contribute monthly to an investment fund. These contributions will entitle beneficiaries (employees) to receive the allocated basic subscription amount, along with any investment returns generated, in place of their end of service benefits.

**Objectives of the scheme**

The Savings scheme aims to protect employees from inflation, default and bankruptcy. It also aims employees to benefit from investing in various economic activities in the UAE.

**Investment options**

The scheme offers a variety of investment options, which include:

- Sharia-compliant funds
- a capital guarantee portfolio option that offers a risk-free investment, for unskilled workers
- and various other investment portfolios that carry varying levels of financial risk based on expected return.

[Daman Investments End of Service Programme](https://daman.ae/end-of-service/)
is approved as one of the investment funds under the Savings scheme. Learn more about [Daman Investments End of Service Programme](https://u.ae/-/media/Documents-2024/damaninsurancebroucherenaspx.pdf)
(PDF, 1.63 MB).

**Scope**

The scheme applies to employers and employees in the private sector and the free zones.

**Participation in the scheme**

Employers who wish to participate in this alternative system must [submit a request to MoHRE.](https://www.mohre.gov.ae/en/services/services-directory.aspx)

Employers must select and contract with one of the investment funds licensed by [Securities and Commodities Authority](https://www.sca.gov.ae/en/home.aspx)
(SCA) to provide these services. They must also determine which employee categories and levels should be included in the scheme.

Companies must discontinue the use of the current end of service benefits system for employees who are selected to participate in this scheme.

Once the employees are chosen, participation in the fund becomes mandatory, and employers must ensure that the employees' entitlements from the previous period are preserved.

**Basic subscription fee**

Employers’ contribution to the investment fund for full-time employees is as follows:

- 5.83 per cent of their employees’ monthly basic salary if the employee has not completed five years of service
- 8.33 per cent if the employee has served more than five years.

Subscriptions must be transferred into the investment fund within 15 days of the beginning of each calendar month.

**Additional voluntary subscription**

In addition to the basic subscription made by the employers, subscribed employees may contribute voluntarily a percentage of their salary or an additional amount, either in instalments or as lump sum.

The voluntary contribution will be deducted from their salaries, provided it does not exceed 25 per cent of the total annual salary.

For more information about subscription in the Savings scheme and fees for other work patterns, refer to [Ministerial Resolution No. 668 of 2023 Regarding Subscription under the Alternative End of Service Benefits System](https://u.ae/-/media/Documents-2nd-half-2023/Ministerial-Resolution-No-668-of-2023-Regarding-Subscription-Under-the-Alternarive-EndofService-Bene.pdf)
– (PDF, 140 KB).

**Entitlements of the employee**

The employee is entitled to all basic subscription amounts paid by the employer and any returns resulting from it during the subscription period, within 14 days after the termination of employment. He also has the option to continue investing in the scheme.

Employees can withdraw part or all of the voluntary contributions or their investment returns at any time during their employment, in accordance with terms set forth by the fund manager.

**Supervision of the scheme**

MoHRE and SCA monitor, supervise and inspect the alternative system in accordance with the applicable legislations.

MoHRE is responsible for receiving labour complaints related to this alternative system and investigating complaints and violations discovered during inspections.

SCA will address complaints regarding the performance of the service providers of the investment funds.

Financial [free zones authorities](https://www.moec.gov.ae/en/free-zones)
are responsible for supervising and resolving complaints regarding the alternative end of service benefits system under their jurisdiction.

As per [Article 51 of the UAE Labour Law](https://www.mohre.gov.ae/en/laws-and-regulations/laws.aspx)
, end of service benefits for foreign workers working in the private sector will be as follows:

- The worker is entitled to a gratuity for the served fraction of a year, provided that he completes one year of continuous service.
- The end of service gratuity is calculated on basis of last wage which the worker was entitled to, namely the basic salary. Hence, it will not include allowances such as housing, conveyance, utilities, furniture etc.
- If the worker owes any money to the employer, the employer may deduct the amount from the worker's gratuity.
- All end of service entitlements must be paid within 14 days from the contract’s end date.

**Calculations for gratuity pay**

A worker who has spent one year or more in continuous service shall be entitled to an end of service gratuity upon the termination of his service. The days of absence from work without pay shall not be included in the calculation of the period of service and the gratuity shall be calculated as follows:

- If a worker has served for less than 1 year, he is not entitled to any gratuity pay.
- If a worker has served for more than 1 year but less than 5 years, he is entitled to full gratuity pay based on 21 days' salary for each year of work.
- If a worker has served more than 5 years, he is entitled to full gratuity of 30 days' salary for each year of work following the first five years.

In all cases, the total gratuity shall not exceed the wage of two years.

### Under other types of employment

As per Article 30 of  the [Cabinet Resolution No. 1 of 2022](https://www.mohre.gov.ae/en/laws-and-regulations/laws.aspx) on the Implementation of the Regulation of Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021 Regarding the Regulation of Labour Relations, the end of service benefits for workers in part time contracts or other types of work arrangements are calculated pursuant to the following:

![Article 30](https://u.ae/-/media/Images-2023/Images-June-2023/Article-30-labour-resolution-English.PNG)

The number of working hours in the employment contract per year divided by the number of working hours in the full time contract per year multiplied by 100 equal to the percentage on which the end of service benefit should be calculated. Then this percentage should be multiplied by the value of the end of service benefit due for the full time contract.

## Emiratis' employment in the private sector

### Emiratisation targets in the private sector

**Nafis  
**The Emirati Human Resources Competitiveness Council, ‘Nafis’ implements national initiatives aimed at increasing Emiratisation in the private sector. The council supports citizens in the private sector by increasing their competitiveness and providing this sector with Emirati skills.

The council aims to get 75,000 citizens into the private sector over the next five years. It also offers many initiatives to empower Emirati cadres and motivate private companies to attract Emirati talent.

**Rate of Emiratisation -** (Companies with 50 or more workers)

The Cabinet approved a decision to raise Emiratisation rates to 2 per cent annually for skilled jobs in private sector establishments with 50 or more employees and to achieve an overall rate of increase by 10 per cent by 2026. This is accompanied by granting incentives to institutions that perform qualitatively in the training and employment of citizens.

To support the commitment to achieve the above employment targets for nationals, non-compliant companies will have to pay an amount of AED 6,000 monthly, starting from January 2023, for every citizen who has not been employed. The amount will be paid through the digital systems of Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE), provided that the value of the monthly contributions increases by AED 1,000 annually until 2026. To monitor the implementation of these decisions in the labour market, MoHRE is working with the Cabinet Secretariat to measure the indicator of Emiratisation in the private sector.

**Expansion of the Emiratisation targets -** (Companies with 20 to 49 workers)

Starting in 2024, private sector companies with a workforce of 20 to 49 workers will be required to hire at least one UAE citizen and from 2025, they would be required to hire at least two Emirati citizens. Previously, this mandate applied only to companies with 50 or more employees.

This requirement is applicable to companies operating in the following 14 sectors:

1.  information and communications
2.  financial and insurance activities
3.  real estate activities
4.  professional, scientific and technical activities
5.  administrative and support services
6.  education
7.  healthcare and social work activities
8.  arts and entertainment
9.  mining and quarrying industry
10. manufacturing
11. construction
12. wholesale and retail trade
13. transportation and warehousing
14. Hospitality services.

Companies with 20 to 49 workers that fail to employ at least one Emirati in 2024 will have to pay a financial contribution of AED 96,000 to the government. This contribution will increase to AED 108,000 for companies that have not employed two Emiratis by 2025.

# Employment laws and regulations

Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021 Regarding the Regulation of Employment Relationship and its amendments, known as the ‘UAE Labour law’, governs the labour rights of employees in the private sector. It applies to all employees working in the UAE, whether UAE nationals or expatriates. However, there are certain categories of employees who are exempt from the law and may have to follow another set of regulations. Learn about employment laws and regulations in the private sector.

### Working in the private sector

**UAE Labour law**

[](https://www.mohre.gov.ae/en/laws-and-regulations/laws.aspx)
[Federal Decree law No. 20 of 2023 Amending Certain Provisions of Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021 Regarding the Regulation of Employment Relationships](https://www.mohre.gov.ae/en/laws-and-regulations/laws.aspx)
, known as the ‘UAE Labour law’ governs the employer-employee relations in the private sector. The provisions of the law apply to all businesses, employees and employers in the private sector. The law became effective on 2 February 2022. It repealed the previous Federal Law No. 8 of 1980.

The new law aims to protect both parties in the employment relationship and enables them to obtain their rights in a balanced manner. It covers matters related to working hours, overtime, leaves, vacation and public holidays, employing juveniles, employee records, safety standards, minimum wage, termination of employment, end of service gratuity payments, work injuries amongst others.

The new law introduces several work models such as full-time, part-time, temporary and flexible. It abolishes the ‘unlimited’ type of contracts and admitted only limited or fixed-term contracts. It grants new types of leaves and tackles issues related to harassment, bullying, physical violence and psychological abuse against employees.

The law prohibits forced labour and discrimination on the basis of gender, race, colour, sex, religion, national or social origin or disability. It also spells out employers’ obligations towards employees.

Scope of the law

The law applies to all employees working in the UAE, whether UAE nationals or expatriates. However, it does not apply to:

- employees and workers of the federal government and the local government entities
- employees of the armed forces, police and security
- domestic servants.

## Tips to stay safe from labour and visa fraud

If somebody offers you a job in the UAE, he/she has to give you an offer letter issued by the UAE’s Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE). You can check the validity of such offer as stated below. Visit or tourist visa does not give you the right to work in the UAE. Working under visit or tourist visa may subject the person to penalties and legal liability.

People who want to enter the UAE for the purpose of work, visit, investment, residence or any other legal purpose could be exposed to visa fraud. Therefore, we listed below some tips to follow before coming to the UAE.

1.  If you are [offered a job in the UAE](https://u.ae/information-and-services/jobs/employment-in-the-private-sector/job-offers-and-work-permits-and-contracts/expatriates-employment-in-private-sector)
    , you must get an offer letter issued by the UAE’s Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MOHRE).
2.  The prospective employees/candidates can verify the job offer’s validity at the UAE embassy in their country. You can use the job offer number to verify employer’s validity at the MOHRE’s website ([enquiry service - application status](https://inquiry.mohre.gov.ae/)
    ).
3.  After you sign the offer letter, the employer will send you an employment visa to enter the UAE. Refer to points 8 and 9 below to verify visa/entry permit validity.
4.  Visit or tourist entry permit/visa does not give you right to work in the UAE. Working under visit or tourist visa will bring you penalties and legal liability.
5.  You should know that the employer is responsible for payment of recruitment expenses as per the UAE’s Labour Law.
6.  Make sure that the company legally exists. You can search the company’s English and Arabic name in the [National Economic register](https://ner.economy.ae/)
    and get company details.
7.  Get your queries answered by MoHRE at telephone number 0097168027666, email [ask@mohre.gov.ae](mailto:ask@mohre.gov.ae)
    or [chat service](https://www.mohre.gov.ae/en/contact-us.aspx)
    .
8.  If you have entry permit/visa issued from Dubai, please verify its validity at the [GDRFA’s website](https://www.gdrfad.gov.ae/en)
    .
9.  Verify validity of an entry permit/visa issued from Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al Quwain, Ras Al Khaimah or Fujairah at the [eChannels platform.](https://smartservices.icp.gov.ae/echannels/web/client/default.html#/login)
10. Tourist visa is issued by UAE-based airlines like Emirates, Etihad, Fly Dubai and Air Arabia. It is also issued by the UAE-based hotels and travel agencies.

11. Learn more about the fees of [visas and entry permits issued from Dubai](https://amer247.com/pricing-list)
    .

12. Get help on visas and entry permits issued from Dubai through [Amer’s chat service](https://chat.gdrfad.gov.ae/WebChatASP/)

## Lost your passport with UAE residence visa on it?

In case you lose your passport in the UAE, report the incident to the police, apply for a new passport (to your country’s embassy in the UAE) and have your residence visa re-stamped on your new passport. If you are in a country other than your home country or the UAE, check with your country’s embassy/consulate in that country on the requirements for reporting a lost passport and issuance of a new passport.

### Lost your passport in the UAE?

If you lose your passport in the UAE, you have to apply for a new passport (to your embassy in the UAE) and have your residence visa re-stamped on your new passport.

However, first report the loss or theft of the passport to the police station nearest to where the incident took place.

Note:

- If the lost passport belongs to a minor, the sponsoring parent should be present to endorse the report.
- If the person who lost the passport is on his employer's sponsorship, he should submit a letter in Arabic about the loss of the passport. The letter should be on the sponsoring employer's letterhead and should be submitted to the police department of the emirate where the residence visa was issued. The sponsor should also provide a photocopy of its licence and establishment card.
- If the person who lost the passport is on family sponsorship, he needs to submit a letter signed by the sponsor and a photocopy of the sponsor’s passport.

**Procedure in case a passport is lost in Dubai**

In Dubai, the procedure for lost passports is linked with [General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs](https://www.gdrfad.gov.ae/en)
and [Dubai Courts.](https://www.dc.gov.ae/PublicServices/Categories.aspx?SiteCategoryName=Public_Services&lang=en)

- Upon receiving the police report, get it stamped by the relevant UAE court, Public Prosecution and [General Directorate of Residency & Foreigners Affairs (GDRFA](https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/visa-and-emirates-id/where-to-apply-for-entry-permits-or-visas)
  in the emirate where the visa was issued.
- After these endorsements, you can return the police report to the station from where you received it and they will issue you a formal ‘lost passport certificate’ in Arabic.
- Based on the formal ‘lost passport certificate’, a person can apply for a new passport at his [embassy/consulate in the UAE.](https://www.mofa.gov.ae/en/Missions/Foreign-Missions-In-UAE)
  Check with your embassy for the requirements.
- When your passport is issued, you have to go back to the GDRFA to stamp your residence visa. Check with the relevant GDRFA about application and fees.
- GDRFA will issue a residence visa with the same validity period as of the old visa if still valid, or it will issue a new one if the visa expired while you were inside the UAE.

**Sources:**

- [Lost items](https://www.dubaipolice.gov.ae/wps/portal/home/services/individualservicescontent/lostitemsDetails?lang=en)
  - Dubai Police

### Lost your passport out of the UAE?

If you lose your passport in the country that issued your passport, you will need to follow the steps required by your country to get a new passport issued.

If you lose the passport in a country you are visiting, check with your passport issuing country’s embassy/consulate in that country on the requirements for reporting a lost passport and getting a new passport.

## Tips to stay safe from labour and visa fraud

If somebody offers you a job in the UAE, he/she has to give you an offer letter issued by the UAE’s Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE). You can check the validity of such offer as stated below. Visit or tourist visa does not give you the right to work in the UAE. Working under visit or tourist visa may subject the person to penalties and legal liability.

People who want to enter the UAE for the purpose of work, visit, investment, residence or any other legal purpose could be exposed to visa fraud. Therefore, we listed below some tips to follow before coming to the UAE.

1.  If you are [offered a job in the UAE](https://u.ae/information-and-services/jobs/employment-in-the-private-sector/job-offers-and-work-permits-and-contracts/expatriates-employment-in-private-sector)
    , you must get an offer letter issued by the UAE’s Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MOHRE).
2.  The prospective employees/candidates can verify the job offer’s validity at the UAE embassy in their country. You can use the job offer number to verify employer’s validity at the MOHRE’s website ([enquiry service - application status](https://inquiry.mohre.gov.ae/)
    ).
3.  After you sign the offer letter, the employer will send you an employment visa to enter the UAE. Refer to points 8 and 9 below to verify visa/entry permit validity.
4.  Visit or tourist entry permit/visa does not give you right to work in the UAE. Working under visit or tourist visa will bring you penalties and legal liability.
5.  You should know that the employer is responsible for payment of recruitment expenses as per the UAE’s Labour Law.
6.  Make sure that the company legally exists. You can search the company’s English and Arabic name in the [National Economic register](https://ner.economy.ae/)
    and get company details.
7.  Get your queries answered by MoHRE at telephone number 0097168027666, email [ask@mohre.gov.ae](mailto:ask@mohre.gov.ae)
    or [chat service](https://www.mohre.gov.ae/en/contact-us.aspx)
    .
8.  If you have entry permit/visa issued from Dubai, please verify its validity at the [GDRFA’s website](https://www.gdrfad.gov.ae/en)
    .
9.  Verify validity of an entry permit/visa issued from Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al Quwain, Ras Al Khaimah or Fujairah at the [eChannels platform.](https://smartservices.icp.gov.ae/echannels/web/client/default.html#/login)
10. Tourist visa is issued by UAE-based airlines like Emirates, Etihad, Fly Dubai and Air Arabia. It is also issued by the UAE-based hotels and travel agencies.

11. Learn more about the fees of [visas and entry permits issued from Dubai](https://amer247.com/pricing-list)
    .

12. Get help on visas and entry permits issued from Dubai through [Amer’s chat service](https://chat.gdrfad.gov.ae/WebChatASP/)
    [.](https://chat.gdrfad.gov.ae/WebChatASP/)

13. Get more information on visas and entry permits issued from Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al Quwain, Ras Al Khaimah and Fujairah through the [chat service of ICP.](https://icp.gov.ae/en/contact-us/)

14. A residence visa cannot be processed for anyone while the applicant is outside the UAE. A residence visa can be issued only when the applicant is inside the UAE having entered the country on entry permit.

## Tips to stay safe from labour and visa fraud

If somebody offers you a job in the UAE, he/she has to give you an offer letter issued by the UAE’s Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE). You can check the validity of such offer as stated below. Visit or tourist visa does not give you the right to work in the UAE. Working under visit or tourist visa may subject the person to penalties and legal liability.

People who want to enter the UAE for the purpose of work, visit, investment, residence or any other legal purpose could be exposed to visa fraud. Therefore, we listed below some tips to follow before coming to the UAE.

1.  If you are [offered a job in the UAE](https://u.ae/information-and-services/jobs/employment-in-the-private-sector/job-offers-and-work-permits-and-contracts/expatriates-employment-in-private-sector)
    , you must get an offer letter issued by the UAE’s Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MOHRE).
2.  The prospective employees/candidates can verify the job offer’s validity at the UAE embassy in their country. You can use the job offer number to verify employer’s validity at the MOHRE’s website ([enquiry service - application status](https://inquiry.mohre.gov.ae/)
    ).
3.  After you sign the offer letter, the employer will send you an employment visa to enter the UAE. Refer to points 8 and 9 below to verify visa/entry permit validity.
4.  Visit or tourist entry permit/visa does not give you right to work in the UAE. Working under visit or tourist visa will bring you penalties and legal liability.
5.  You should know that the employer is responsible for payment of recruitment expenses as per the UAE’s Labour Law.
6.  Make sure that the company legally exists. You can search the company’s English and Arabic name in the [National Economic register](https://ner.economy.ae/)
    and get company details.
7.  Get your queries answered by MoHRE at telephone number 0097168027666, email [ask@mohre.gov.ae](mailto:ask@mohre.gov.ae)
    or [chat service](https://www.mohre.gov.ae/en/contact-us.aspx)
    .
8.  If you have entry permit/visa issued from Dubai, please verify its validity at the [GDRFA’s website](https://www.gdrfad.gov.ae/en)
    .
9.  Verify validity of an entry permit/visa issued from Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al Quwain, Ras Al Khaimah or Fujairah at the [eChannels platform.](https://smartservices.icp.gov.ae/echannels/web/client/default.html#/login)
10. Tourist visa is issued by UAE-based airlines like Emirates, Etihad, Fly Dubai and Air Arabia. It is also issued by the UAE-based hotels and travel agencies.

11. Learn more about the fees of [visas and entry permits issued from Dubai](https://amer247.com/pricing-list)
    .

12. Get help on visas and entry permits issued from Dubai through [Amer’s chat service](https://chat.gdrfad.gov.ae/WebChatASP/)
    [.](https://chat.gdrfad.gov.ae/WebChatASP/)

13. Get more information on visas and entry permits issued from Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al Quwain, Ras Al Khaimah and Fujairah through the [chat service of ICP.](https://icp.gov.ae/en/contact-us/)

14. A residence visa cannot be processed for anyone while the applicant is outside the UAE. A residence visa can be issued only when the applicant is inside the UAE having entered the country on entry permit.

# GCC Nationals working in the private sector

GCC nationals working in the private sector shall be treated as UAE nationals in terms of all employment procedures. GCC nationals employed in the UAE are entitled to pension in accordance with the schemes established in their home countries.

### Provisions for employing GCC nationals

According to [Cabinet Resolution No. 72/5 for the year 2007](http://www.mohre.gov.ae/handlers/download.ashx?YXNzZXQ9MTE5MQ%3d%3d)
(Arabic only), GCC nationals working in the private sector shall be treated equally to UAE nationals working in the private sector, in terms of all employment procedures provided that the Emiratisation quota allocated for UAE nationals will not be affected.

Further, as per [Cabinet Resolution No. 18 for the year 2007](http://gpssa.gov.ae/Documents/قرار%20مجلس%20الوزراء%20رقم%2018%20لسنة%202007%20بشأن%20القواعد%20التنفيذية%20لتطبيق%20أحكام%20نظام%20مد%20الحماية%20التأمينية.pdf)

### One of the best passports in the world

According to [Arton Capital's Passport Index](https://www.passportindex.org/byRank.php?f=)
, the UAE passport holds the 1st position globally as of July 2024. A holder of the UAE’s [passport could travel to 179 countries](https://discover.passportindex.org/press-releases/uae-passport-grants-citizens-access-to-90-per-cent-of-the-world/)
; 134 destinations offer visa-free travel, 45 offer eVisa or visa on arrival at the airport, and only 19 countries need the citizens to apply for a visa.

Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) had launched [the UAE Passport Force initiative](https://www.mofa.gov.ae/en/the-UAE/UAE-the-achiever/Passport-Strength)
, with the view to place the country's passport on the list of the five most important passports in the world upon the directives of Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs.

The ranking was mainly boosted from its Schengen visa waiver obtained in 2015. The UAE is the first Arab nation whose citizens enjoy a visa waiver to the 26 Schengen countries, which make up most of Europe.

### Expiry of residence visa on staying out of the UAE

The general rule is that if an expatriate resident lives outside the UAE for more than 180 days continuously, his/her residence visa will be nullified automatically. If this happens, they will have to apply for a new entry permit to enter the UAE again.

However, there are some exceptions which allow an expatriate resident to stay outside the UAE for more than six months and at the same time maintain the validity of his/her residence visa. The rule does not apply to:

- foreigner wife of an Emirati citizen
- domestic helpers accompanying Emiratis having a scholarship for study abroad
- domestic helpers accompanying UAE patients travelling or sent abroad for treatment
- expatriate residents and their companions sent abroad for treatment, provided they submit a medical report approved by medical authorities in the UAE
- domestic helpers accompanying members of diplomatic and consular missions representing the UAE abroad and employees of such missions holding residence visas in the UAE
- expatriate residents working for the public sector sent by their employers to attend training or specialist courses, or those working in their employers' offices abroad and their families who are holders of valid residence visas in the UAE
- expatriate students studying in universities or institutes abroad (as per Dubai rules). Check with the ICP if this applies to your emirate of residence.
- domestic helpers of members of the ruling families working in the homes of the royal family abroad and are holders of valid residence visas in the UAE
- students enrolled in educational institutions abroad, who are holders of valid residence visas in the UAE
- investors holding valid residence visas in the UAE
- residents sponsored by UAE diplomatic and consular representatives and their dependents
- any other person excluded under a decision from ICP, provided that person has a valid residence visa and pay the due fees.

### Renewing your residence visa

Your sponsor must renew your residence visa before it expires. A renewed visa will let you continue living legally in the UAE without incurring fines or facing legal consequences for the same. UAE residents are granted longer flexible grace periods that reach up to 6 months (according to resident cateogry) to stay in the country after the residence permit is cancelled or expired.

The [ICP has standardised](https://gulfnews.com/uae/uae-overstaying-fees-reduces-for-visitors-increases-for-residents-1.91798598)
the overstaying fines in the UAE. According to the new rules, visit, tourist and residence visa overstaying fees have standardised at AED 50 per day. Those overstaying on a residency visa will have to pay AED 50 each day (AED 50 per day instead of AED 25).

Remember that when the visa expires, your Emirates ID card issued by the ICP also expires.

If there is a need to renew your residence visa a few months earlier (one to six months) for travelling reasons, you must first take special permission and approval from ICP.

### Cancelling your residence visa

If you a have a residence visa sponsored either by a family member or by your employer, and you decide to leave the country permanently, your residence visa must be cancelled officially.

Normally, only the sponsor can cancel your residence visa. You cannot process the application on your own.

If a company decides to cancel an employment visa of its employee, it must first approach [Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation](https://www.mohre.gov.ae/en/home.aspx)
with an application to cancel the employee’s labour contract and labour card. The employee must also sign this application. Then, the employer should apply to ICP for visa cancellation.

The company must also cancel the work permit. For this, it must submit a letter signed by the employee stating that he has already received all his wages and end of services benefits to Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation.

An individual sponsoring his/her spouse, children and other dependents must cancel the dependents’ visas before he cancels his/her own.

**How to cancel your residence visa?**

There are two ways to cancel your visa. You can do it either through a registered typing centre or online.

- **Registered** typing **centre**s

  The sponsor may visit any [typing office registered by ICP](https://icp.gov.ae/en/typing-offices/)
  in the respective emirate. The typing office will fill the cancellation form on your behalf and process it online through ICP.

- **Online**

Alternatively, the sponsor may process the cancellation [online through the ICP website](https://icp.gov.ae/en/service/cancel-residency-permit/)
or the ICP application [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.echannels.moismartservices)

### One of the best passports in the world

According to [Arton Capital's Passport Index](https://www.passportindex.org/byRank.php?f=)
, the UAE passport holds the 1st position globally as of July 2024. A holder of the UAE’s [passport could travel to 179 countries](https://discover.passportindex.org/press-releases/uae-passport-grants-citizens-access-to-90-per-cent-of-the-world/)
; 134 destinations offer visa-free travel, 45 offer eVisa or visa on arrival at the airport, and only 19 countries need the citizens to apply for a visa.

Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) had launched [the UAE Passport Force initiative](https://www.mofa.gov.ae/en/the-UAE/UAE-the-achiever/Passport-Strength)
, with the view to place the country's passport on the list of the five most important passports in the world upon the directives of Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs.

The ranking was mainly boosted from its Schengen visa waiver obtained in 2015. The UAE is the first Arab nation whose citizens enjoy a visa waiver to the 26 Schengen countries, which make up most of Europe.

### One of the best passports in the world

According to [Arton Capital's Passport Index](https://www.passportindex.org/byRank.php?f=)
, the UAE passport holds the 1st position globally as of July 2024. A holder of the UAE’s [passport could travel to 179 countries](https://discover.passportindex.org/press-releases/uae-passport-grants-citizens-access-to-90-per-cent-of-the-world/)
; 134 destinations offer visa-free travel, 45 offer eVisa or visa on arrival at the airport, and only 19 countries need the citizens to apply for a visa.

Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) had launched [the UAE Passport Force initiative](https://www.mofa.gov.ae/en/the-UAE/UAE-the-achiever/Passport-Strength)
, with the view to place the country's passport on the list of the five most important passports in the world upon the directives of Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs.

The ranking was mainly boosted from its Schengen visa waiver obtained in 2015. The UAE is the first Arab nation whose citizens enjoy a visa waiver to the 26 Schengen countries, which make up most of Europe.

# Preparing to work

Foreigners wishing to work in the UAE must make sure that their passports are valid for at least six months. Degree certificates obtained from outside the UAE need to be attested. All foreigners will be tested for communicable diseases/conditions such as those related to HIV and/or TB.

### Passport and visas

Before coming to the UAE, make sure that your passport is authentic and valid for at least six months.

Foreigners planning to work in the UAE must know that they cannot work on visit visas or tourist visas. They need legitimate [work/residency visa/permit to be able to live and work legally in the UAE.](https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/visa-and-emirates-id/residence-visas)
The employer needs to procure the work and residency permits. Working without first obtaining the proper visa status is illegal and can lead to penalties and legal liability. The penalties apply to both: the employer and the employee.

### Health screening

Foreigners [planning to work in the UAE will need to undergo medical tests](https://www.ehs.gov.ae/en/services/services-directory/pre-employment-fitness-screening)
at government approved health centres in the UAE. Candidates will be tested for communicable diseases/conditions such as those related to HIV and/or TB. Those found to be HIV positive or having tuberculosis will be deported immediately by the UAE authorities. Hence, if you suspect that you suffer from a communicable disease it is advisable to get tested in your home country first.

As per [Cabinet Resolution passed in 2016](https://uaecabinet.ae/en/details/news/dubai-ruler-issues-cabinet-decree-to-amending-expatriates-medical-examination-system)
, all resident expatriates while renewing their residence visas have to undergo TB screening. Those found with scars or active TB or found having drug-resistant TB will be issued a conditional fitness certificate and be issued residence visa for one year. They will then have to undergo treatment in the UAE.

### Certifications attestation

In the UAE, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) [attests documents digitally;](https://www.mofa.gov.ae/en/Services/Attestation)
while outside the UAE, it attests them through its [embassies and consulates](https://www.mofa.gov.ae/en/Missions/UAE-Missions-Abroad).

Document attestation is a procedure that confirms the validity of seals and signatures on documents and instruments, regardless of where they originate.

Types of documents attested

MoFA attests various individual affairs’ documents including birth, death and marriage certificates; as well as, commercial documents such as contracts and agreements, minutes of meeting, trademark registrations and company closure documents.

Steps for getting documents attested

**For documents issued in the UAE**

For documents issued in the UAE, the original document needs to be attested first by the relevant government entity. However, this is not required for digitally issued or electronically attested documents.

**For documents issued outside the UAE**

For documents issued outside the UAE, the original document should be attested first by Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the issuing country. Afterwards, the document can be attested by a UAE Embassy or Consulate in that country by applying through the UAE’s MoFA online channels.

If there is no UAE mission in a particular country, applicants may [contact MoFA](https://www.mofa.gov.ae/en/Contact-us)
for assistance.

Customers can process all transactions related to attestation services through [MoFA’s official website](https://www.mofa.gov.ae/)
and its app UAEMOFA available on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mob.uae&hl=en)
and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/uae-mofa/id540714559)
. Upon the approval of the transaction, applicants in the UAE can send the original documents to MoFA via courier and receive them back attested, through the same courier service.

## General provisions for the residence visa

The validity of a residence visa varies according to its type and the sponsor. Read about the other requirements and the steps to apply. Also read about the steps to renew and cancel your residence visa.

### Validity of a residence visa

The validity of a residence visa varies according to its type and the sponsor. It can be for 1, 2 or 3 years on a sponsored visa, or up to 5 or 10 years on an unsponsored visa.

According to recent changes, a residence visa can also be issued for 5 and 10 years, subject to certain conditions. Learn about [long-term residence visas](https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/visa-and-emirates-id/residence-visas/golden-visa)
, and [5-year retirement visa](https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/visa-and-emirates-id/residence-visas/residence-visa-for-the-retired)
in the UAE.

The expiry date of the dependent’s residence visa will not exceed that of the sponsor.

### Medical test

A residence visa requires applicants who are 18 and above to undergo [a medical test](https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/health-and-fitness/health-conditions-for-uae-residence-visa)
to prove that they are medically fit. They must also pass a security check and apply for an [Emirates ID card](https://icp.gov.ae/en/service/apply-for-a-new-id-card-2/)
from Federal Authority for Identity and Citizenship.

### Required documents

- A recent coloured personal photo with a white background for the dependent
- A copy of the passport of the dependent
- Emirates ID Application receipt
- Housing lease contract (certified) or proof of owning a residence
- A copy of the sponsor’s passport with a valid residence permit
- Job contract of the sponsor
- A medical fitness certificate (for dependents above 18 years)
- Entry permit
- Attested birth certificate of the dependent (children)
- Mother’s residence photo (for the newborn)
- Medical insurance or health card
- Divorce or death certificate (for divorced women and widows)
- Proof of housing (for divorced women and widows)
- a proof of the woman’s ability to earn a living (for divorced women and widows)
- A certificate issued by the university or institute specifying the duration of the study (for students).

### Extension of the residence visa for divorced women and widows

When a woman living in the UAE on her husband’s visa, is divorced or widowed, the UAE Government grants her an extension of one year on her residence visa. The extension starts from the date of the death of her husband or the divorce. This type of visa is renewable for one time only and does not require a substitute sponsor. The extension applies to the woman’s children as well, provided they were on their father’s visa at the time of their father’s death or their parents’ divorce.

In addition,

- the visas of the woman and her children must have been valid at the time of the death or the divorce
- the duration of the child’s/children’s residence visa should not exceed that of the mother.

### Expiry of residence visa on staying out of the UAE

The general rule is that if an expatriate resident lives outside the UAE for more than 180 days continuously, his/her residence visa will be nullified automatically. If this happens, they will have to apply for a new entry permit to enter the UAE again.

However, there are some exceptions which allow an expatriate resident to stay outside the UAE for more than six months and at the same time maintain the validity of his/her residence visa. The rule does not apply to:

- foreigner wife of an Emirati citizen
- domestic helpers accompanying Emiratis having a scholarship for study abroad
- domestic helpers accompanying UAE patients travelling or sent abroad for treatment
- expatriate residents and their companions sent abroad for treatment, provided they submit a medical report approved by medical authorities in the UAE
- domestic helpers accompanying members of diplomatic and consular missions representing the UAE abroad and employees of such missions holding residence visas in the UAE
- expatriate residents working for the public sector sent by their employers to attend training or specialist courses, or those working in their employers' offices abroad and their families who are holders of valid residence visas in the UAE
- expatriate students studying in universities or institutes abroad (as per Dubai rules). Check with the ICP if this applies to your emirate of residence.
- domestic helpers of members of the ruling families working in the homes of the royal family abroad and are holders of valid residence visas in the UAE
- students enrolled in educational institutions abroad, who are holders of valid residence visas in the UAE
- investors holding valid residence visas in the UAE
- residents sponsored by UAE diplomatic and consular representatives and their dependents
- any other person excluded under a decision from ICP, provided that person has a valid residence visa and pay the due fees.

- [Track your visa application](/en/information-and-services/visa-and-emirates-id/track-visa-application-and-validity)

### Renewing your residence visa

Your sponsor must renew your residence visa before it expires. A renewed visa will let you continue living legally in the UAE without incurring fines or facing legal consequences for the same. UAE residents are granted longer flexible grace periods that reach up to 6 months (according to resident cateogry) to stay in the country after the residence permit is cancelled or expired.

The [ICP has standardised](https://gulfnews.com/uae/uae-overstaying-fees-reduces-for-visitors-increases-for-residents-1.91798598)
the overstaying fines in the UAE. According to the new rules, visit, tourist and residence visa overstaying fees have standardised at AED 50 per day. Those overstaying on a residency visa will have to pay AED 50 each day (AED 50 per day instead of AED 25).

Remember that when the visa expires, your Emirates ID card issued by the ICP also expires.

If there is a need to renew your residence visa a few months earlier (one to six months) for travelling reasons, you must first take special permission and approval from ICP.

### Cancelling your residence visa

If you a have a residence visa sponsored either by a family member or by your employer, and you decide to leave the country permanently, your residence visa must be cancelled officially.

Normally, only the sponsor can cancel your residence visa. You cannot process the application on your own.

If a company decides to cancel an employment visa of its employee, it must first approach [Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation](https://www.mohre.gov.ae/en/home.aspx)
with an application to cancel the employee’s labour contract and labour card. The employee must also sign this application. Then, the employer should apply to ICP for visa cancellation.

The company must also cancel the work permit. For this, it must submit a letter signed by the employee stating that he has already received all his wages and end of services benefits to Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation.

An individual sponsoring his/her spouse, children and other dependents must cancel the dependents’ visas before he cancels his/her own.

**How to cancel your residence visa?**

There are two ways to cancel your visa. You can do it either through a registered typing centre or online.

- **Registered** typing **centre**s

  The sponsor may visit any [typing office registered by ICP](https://icp.gov.ae/en/typing-offices/)
  in the respective emirate. The typing office will fill the cancellation form on your behalf and process it online through ICP.

- **Online**

Alternatively, the sponsor may process the cancellation [online through the ICP website](https://icp.gov.ae/en/service/cancel-residency-permit/)
or the ICP application [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.echannels.moismartservices)

### International Driving Permit

UAE citizens and residents who intend to drive in a foreign country are required to apply for an International Driving Permit (IDP) while in the UAE. The IDP is a United Nations convention and a legal requirement that allows motorists to drive their vehicles outside the UAE legally, without the need for further tests and applications.

The permit is valid for one year and the following documents are required to get it:

- IDL form
- a copy of Emirates ID
- a copy of passport and valid residency
- a copy of valid UAE driving licence
- two photos (passport size).

IDP can be obtained through the following entities:

# Preparing to work

Foreigners wishing to work in the UAE must make sure that their passports are valid for at least six months. Degree certificates obtained from outside the UAE need to be attested. All foreigners will be tested for communicable diseases/conditions such as those related to HIV and/or TB.

### Passport and visas

Before coming to the UAE, make sure that your passport is authentic and valid for at least six months.

Foreigners planning to work in the UAE must know that they cannot work on visit visas or tourist visas. They need legitimate [work/residency visa/permit to be able to live and work legally in the UAE.](https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/visa-and-emirates-id/residence-visas)
The employer needs to procure the work and residency permits. Working without first obtaining the proper visa status is illegal and can lead to penalties and legal liability. The penalties apply to both: the employer and the employee.

### Health screening

Foreigners [planning to work in the UAE will need to undergo medical tests](https://www.ehs.gov.ae/en/services/services-directory/pre-employment-fitness-screening)
at government approved health centres in the UAE. Candidates will be tested for communicable diseases/conditions such as those related to HIV and/or TB. Those found to be HIV positive or having tuberculosis will be deported immediately by the UAE authorities. Hence, if you suspect that you suffer from a communicable disease it is advisable to get tested in your home country first.

As per [Cabinet Resolution passed in 2016](https://uaecabinet.ae/en/details/news/dubai-ruler-issues-cabinet-decree-to-amending-expatriates-medical-examination-system)
, all resident expatriates while renewing their residence visas have to undergo TB screening. Those found with scars or active TB or found having drug-resistant TB will be issued a conditional fitness certificate and be issued residence visa for one year. They will then have to undergo treatment in the UAE.

### Certifications attestation

In the UAE, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) [attests documents digitally;](https://www.mofa.gov.ae/en/Services/Attestation)
while outside the UAE, it attests them through its [embassies and consulates](https://www.mofa.gov.ae/en/Missions/UAE-Missions-Abroad).

Document attestation is a procedure that confirms the validity of seals and signatures on documents and instruments, regardless of where they originate.

Types of documents attested

MoFA attests various individual affairs’ documents including birth, death and marriage certificates; as well as, commercial documents such as contracts and agreements, minutes of meeting, trademark registrations and company closure documents.

Steps for getting documents attested

**For documents issued in the UAE**

For documents issued in the UAE, the original document needs to be attested first by the relevant government entity. However, this is not required for digitally issued or electronically attested documents.

**For documents issued outside the UAE**

For documents issued outside the UAE, the original document should be attested first by Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the issuing country. Afterwards, the document can be attested by a UAE Embassy or Consulate in that country by applying through the UAE’s MoFA online channels.

If there is no UAE mission in a particular country, applicants may [contact MoFA](https://www.mofa.gov.ae/en/Contact-us)
for assistance.

Customers can process all transactions related to attestation services through [MoFA’s official website](https://www.mofa.gov.ae/)
and its app UAEMOFA available on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mob.uae&hl=en)
and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/uae-mofa/id540714559)
. Upon the approval of the transaction, applicants in the UAE can send the original documents to MoFA via courier and receive them back attested, through the same courier service.

[Read more on documents’ attestation services and find the steps to apply.](https://www.mofa.gov.ae/en/services/attestation)

Refer to this [guide on documents attestation](https://u.ae/-/media/Documents-2023/Documents-December-2023/Users-guide-for-documents-attestation-En.pdf)
(PDF, 13.0 MB)

### Additional tests

Medical professionals such as physicians, lab technicians and others are required to [take an exam from](https://mohap.gov.ae/en/services/health-professional-evaluation)
[Ministry of Health and Prevention](https://mohap.gov.ae/en/services/health-professional-evaluation)
in order to practice the profession in the UAE.

### Restricted professions

Some professions, such as that of a lawyer licensed to appear before the judge and carry out the defence can be practised only by UAE nationals. Read about [Emiratisation](https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/jobs/emiratisation)
.

### Your rights and duties

Read the [UAE Labour Law](https://www.mohre.gov.ae/en/laws-and-regulations/laws.aspx)

 or a [visa-free entry](https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/visa-and-emirates-id/do-you-need-an-entry-permit-or-a-visa-to-enter-the-uae/visa-free-entry)

 for verification.

## General provisions for the residence visa

The validity of a residence visa varies according to its type and the sponsor. Read about the other requirements and the steps to apply. Also read about the steps to renew and cancel your residence visa.

### Validity of a residence visa

The validity of a residence visa varies according to its type and the sponsor. It can be for 1, 2 or 3 years on a sponsored visa, or up to 5 or 10 years on an unsponsored visa.

According to recent changes, a residence visa can also be issued for 5 and 10 years, subject to certain conditions. Learn about [long-term residence visas](https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/visa-and-emirates-id/residence-visas/golden-visa)
, and [5-year retirement visa](https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/visa-and-emirates-id/residence-visas/residence-visa-for-the-retired)
in the UAE.

The expiry date of the dependent’s residence visa will not exceed that of the sponsor.

### Medical test

A residence visa requires applicants who are 18 and above to undergo [a medical test](https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/health-and-fitness/health-conditions-for-uae-residence-visa)
to prove that they are medically fit. They must also pass a security check and apply for an [Emirates ID card](https://icp.gov.ae/en/service/apply-for-a-new-id-card-2/)

### Required documents

The extension starts from the date of the death of her husband or the divorce. This type of visa is renewable for one time only and does not require a substitute sponsor. The extension applies to the woman’s children as well, provided they were on their father’s visa at the time of their father’s death or their parents’ divorce.

In addition,

- the visas of the woman and her children must have been valid at the time of the death or the divorce
- the duration of the child’s/children’s residence visa should not exceed that of the mother.

- [Track your visa application](/en/information-and-services/visa-and-emirates-id/track-visa-application-and-validity)

### Renewing your residence visa

Your sponsor must renew your residence visa before it expires. A renewed visa will let you continue living legally in the UAE without incurring fines or facing legal consequences for the same. UAE residents are granted longer flexible grace periods that reach up to 6 months (according to resident cateogry) to stay in the country after the residence permit is cancelled or expired.

The [ICP has standardised](https://gulfnews.com/uae/uae-overstaying-fees-reduces-for-visitors-increases-for-residents-1.91798598)
the overstaying fines in the UAE. According to the new rules, visit, tourist and residence visa overstaying fees have standardised at AED 50 per day. Those overstaying on a residency visa will have to pay AED 50 each day (AED 50 per day instead of AED 25).

Remember that when the visa expires, your Emirates ID card issued by the ICP also expires.

If there is a need to renew your residence visa a few months earlier (one to six months) for travelling reasons, you must first take special permission and approval from ICP.

### Cancelling your residence visa

If you a have a residence visa sponsored either by a family member or by your employer, and you decide to leave the country permanently, your residence visa must be cancelled officially.

Normally, only the sponsor can cancel your residence visa. You cannot process the application on your own.

If a company decides to cancel an employment visa of its employee, it must first approach [Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation](https://www.mohre.gov.ae/en/home.aspx)
with an application to cancel the employee’s labour contract and labour card. The employee must also sign this application. Then, the employer should apply to ICP for visa cancellation.

The company must also cancel the work permit. For this, it must submit a letter signed by the employee stating that he has already received all his wages and end of services benefits to Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation.

An individual sponsoring his/her spouse, children and other dependents must cancel the dependents’ visas before he cancels his/her own.

**How to cancel your residence visa?**

There are two ways to cancel your visa. You can do it either through a registered typing centre or online.

- **Registered** typing **centre**s

  The sponsor may visit any [typing office registered by ICP](https://icp.gov.ae/en/typing-offices/)
  in the respective emirate. The typing office will fill the cancellation form on your behalf and process it online through ICP.

- **Online**

Alternatively, the sponsor may process the cancellation [online through the ICP website](https://icp.gov.ae/en/service/cancel-residency-permit/)
or the ICP application [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.echannels.moismartservices)

# Preparing to work

Foreigners wishing to work in the UAE must make sure that their passports are valid for at least six months. Degree certificates obtained from outside the UAE need to be attested. All foreigners will be tested for communicable diseases/conditions such as those related to HIV and/or TB.

### Passport and visas

Before coming to the UAE, make sure that your passport is authentic and valid for at least six months.

Foreigners planning to work in the UAE must know that they cannot work on visit visas or tourist visas. They need legitimate [work/residency visa/permit to be able to live and work legally in the UAE.](https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/visa-and-emirates-id/residence-visas)
The employer needs to procure the work and residency permits. Working without first obtaining the proper visa status is illegal and can lead to penalties and legal liability. The penalties apply to both: the employer and the employee.

### Health screening

Foreigners [planning to work in the UAE will need to undergo medical tests](https://www.ehs.gov.ae/en/services/services-directory/pre-employment-fitness-screening)
at government approved health centres in the UAE. Candidates will be tested for communicable diseases/conditions such as those related to HIV and/or TB. Those found to be HIV positive or having tuberculosis will be deported immediately by the UAE authorities. Hence, if you suspect that you suffer from a communicable disease it is advisable to get tested in your home country first.

As per [Cabinet Resolution passed in 2016](https://uaecabinet.ae/en/details/news/dubai-ruler-issues-cabinet-decree-to-amending-expatriates-medical-examination-system)
, all resident expatriates while renewing their residence visas have to undergo TB screening. Those found with scars or active TB or found having drug-resistant TB will be issued a conditional fitness certificate and be issued residence visa for one year. They will then have to undergo treatment in the UAE.

### Certifications attestation

In the UAE, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) [attests documents digitally;](https://www.mofa.gov.ae/en/Services/Attestation)
while outside the UAE, it attests them through its [embassies and consulates](https://www.mofa.gov.ae/en/Missions/UAE-Missions-Abroad).

Document attestation is a procedure that confirms the validity of seals and signatures on documents and instruments, regardless of where they originate.

Types of documents attested

MoFA attests various individual affairs’ documents including birth, death and marriage certificates; as well as, commercial documents such as contracts and agreements, minutes of meeting, trademark registrations and company closure documents.

Steps for getting documents attested

**For documents issued in the UAE**

For documents issued in the UAE, the original document needs to be attested first by the relevant government entity. However, this is not required for digitally issued or electronically attested documents.

**For documents issued outside the UAE**

For documents issued outside the UAE, the original document should be attested first by Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the issuing country. Afterwards, the document can be attested by a UAE Embassy or Consulate in that country by applying through the UAE’s MoFA online channels.

If there is no UAE mission in a particular country, applicants may [contact MoFA](https://www.mofa.gov.ae/en/Contact-us)
for assistance.

Customers can process all transactions related to attestation services through [MoFA’s official website](https://www.mofa.gov.ae/)
and its app UAEMOFA available on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mob.uae&hl=en)
and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/uae-mofa/id540714559)
. Upon the approval of the transaction, applicants in the UAE can send the original documents to MoFA via courier and receive them back attested, through the same courier service.

Medical professionals such as physicians, lab technicians and others are required to [take an exam from](https://mohap.gov.ae/en/services/health-professional-evaluation)
[Ministry of Health and Prevention](https://mohap.gov.ae/en/services/health-professional-evaluation)
in order to practice the profession in the UAE.

Some professions, such as that of a lawyer licensed to appear before the judge and carry out the defence can be practised only by UAE nationals. Read about [Emiratisation](https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/jobs/emiratisation)
.

### Search at online job fairs

Several job fairs are held in the UAE. They provide job seekers with the opportunity to get to know participating organisations, their roles and job vacancies within. These are particularly good for fresh graduates as it helps them to decide on the industry in which they could build a career. Job fairs also offer networking opportunity for jobseekers.

Some of the job fairs in the UAE are:

- [Career fairs in Abu Dhabi](https://www.tamm.abudhabi/en/articles/career-fairs-in-abu-dhabi)
- [Careers UAE](http://www.careersuae.ae/)
- National Career Exhibition.

### Look through classifieds

Job vacancies are posted in the classifieds section of online and print publications. Almost all newspapers have a classifieds section. The job vacancies are posted in both, online and print editions. In the UAE, newspapers are published in several languages. English and Arabic are the main languages.

Below are links to the classifieds section of some of the English newspapers in the UAE:

- [Khaleej Times](http://buzzon.khaleejtimes.com/ad-category/jobs-vacancies/)

The following are exclusively dedicated to classifieds:

- [Dubizzle](https://uae.dubizzle.com/)
- [Waseet](https://ae.waseet.net/en)
  (also available in print)

If you are looking for a job from outside the UAE, you can search for jobs in the 'overseas jobs' or similar section in the newspapers in your country.

### Recruitment agencies

You can send your CV to licensed recruitment agencies in the UAE. The agency will contact you in case there is a job opening suitable for your qualifications and interests.

[Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation- MoHRE](http://www.mohre.gov.ae/en/home.aspx)
  grants licences of recruitment agencies to UAE citizens only.

Job seekers are not required to pay money to any recruitment agency as the onus to pay such fees lies with the employers.

You can refer to the ministry to check for licensed companies or raise a complaint, if needed.

Refer to MoHRE for provisions which regulate the work of  the [recruitment agencies.](https://www.mohre.gov.ae/en/laws-and-regulations/resolutions-and-circulars.aspx)

### Look through websites

You can also look through the careers pages and register on the careers section of websites of organisations you wish to join.

[Federal and local government entities](https://u.ae/en/help/contact-us/the-government)
 announce job vacancies on their websites. You can apply through their websites.

**Useful links:**

- [Business directories of the UAE government](/en/information-and-services/business/accessing-services/accessing-services-for-mainland-companies#government-commercial-directories)
- [Companies and businesses in the UAE](http://www.yellowpages.ae/)
   \- Yellow Pages directory

### Create an account on professional networking websites

Job opportunities are widely posted on professional networking websites such as [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com)
, which also offer networking opportunity. You can look for similar websites.

### Tips to land a job

- Start with an impressive cover letter and an honest CV.
- Keep your CV updated.
- Be diligent and regular in searching. Do not give up mid-way.
- Check for the email ID from which you receive job offers. It should reflect the domain name of the organisation.
- Do not pay. If the hiring company or the agency asks you for money to process the visa or medical test, it is not a genuine company.
- Learn Arabic. Knowledge of Arabic (at least speaking) would be an advantage.
- Keep yourself updated about your field of work.
- Be realistic about your earning potential.
- Grow your network.
- Increase your general knowledge about the region and its social and cultural value system.

### One of the best passports in the world

According to [Arton Capital's Passport Index](https://www.passportindex.org/byRank.php?f=)
, the UAE passport holds the 1st position globally as of July 2024. A holder of the UAE’s [passport could travel to 179 countries](https://discover.passportindex.org/press-releases/uae-passport-grants-citizens-access-to-90-per-cent-of-the-world/)
; 134 destinations offer visa-free travel, 45 offer eVisa or visa on arrival at the airport, and only 19 countries need the citizens to apply for a visa.

Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) had launched [the UAE Passport Force initiative](https://www.mofa.gov.ae/en/the-UAE/UAE-the-achiever/Passport-Strength)
, with the view to place the country's passport on the list of the five most important passports in the world upon the directives of Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs.

The ranking was mainly boosted from its Schengen visa waiver obtained in 2015. The UAE is the first Arab nation whose citizens enjoy a visa waiver to the 26 Schengen countries, which make up most of Europe.

### Registering a death abroad

In the unfortunate event of death abroad, UAE citizens and residents must obtain a death certificate and contact their embassy in that country for further procedures.

In the case of a death of a UAE national, the UAE embassy in the country where death occurred would attest the death certificate issued abroad and arrange for transporting the body to the UAE. If the death certificate is in a language other than Arabic, such certificate should be translated legally into Arabic and then be attested by the embassy.

## Tips to stay safe from labour and visa fraud

If somebody offers you a job in the UAE, he/she has to give you an offer letter issued by the UAE’s Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE). You can check the validity of such offer as stated below. Visit or tourist visa does not give you the right to work in the UAE. Working under visit or tourist visa may subject the person to penalties and legal liability.

6.  Make sure that the company legally exists. You can search the company’s English and Arabic name in the [National Economic register](https://ner.economy.ae/)
    and get company details.
