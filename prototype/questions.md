My company has been delaying salary payments for almost two months. When we ask about it, they respond with vague excuses such as a lack of funds and don't take the issue seriously. They expect us to continue working as if nothing is wrong and discourage any discussion about salaries. how can we address this situation through MOHRE, and what actions or penalties can be taken against the company for such behavior ?

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ What MOHRE can do

| Stage                                                      | What MOHRE will do                                                                                     | Penalties/Consequences for the employer                                                            |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Electronic monitoring** (immediately after the due date) | MOHRE tracks whether the employer has transferred the wages through the Wages Protection System (WPS). | No action yet, but a record is kept.                                                               |
| **Reminders** (3rd and 10th day after the due date)        | Automated emails/SMS/notifications are sent to the employer.                                           | Still no direct penalty, but the employer‚Äôs record of non‚Äëcompliance begins to build.              |
| **17th day after the due date**                            | MOHRE suspends **new work permits** for the employer.                                                  | Existing employees may still work, but no new employees can be hired until payment is regularised. |
| **45 days after the due date**                             | MOHRE can list the employer in the _Electronic Monitoring and Inspection System_.                      | An inspector will visit, issue warnings, and can enforce further sanctions.                        |
| **Repeated defaults**                                      | Reclassification of the establishment to Category‚ÄØ3 (high‚Äërisk employers).                             | Higher monitoring intensity, more frequent inspections, and potentially **administrative fines**.  |
| **Failure to provide proof of payment**                    | MOHRE can impose a fine up to AED‚ÄØ10,000 (or more, depending on the size of the establishment).        | Fine plus possible revocation of existing work permits.                                            |

> **Key point:** The law requires that at least **80‚ÄØ% of the total wages** be transferred via WPS. If an employer falls short, the employee is _still entitled to full pay_, and MOHRE will step in.
